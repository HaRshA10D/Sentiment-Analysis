SHOULD YOU BUY THIS PHONE in 2017 ?
YES, definitely go for this phone over iphone 7. Its value for money product and after all its a iPhone.
Please Purchase 32GB version as its Cheaper or same that of 16GB version (Didn't understand why this abnormal pricing).
If you want you 1st iPHONE, then PLEASE, DO NOT Purchase iphone 7 over this, because its much expensive, has almost Similar Features and user Experience and Most Importantly iPhone 8 is Coming this Year, so it would be Foolish to go for iPhone 7 over 6s.

Faulty product,Phone was fine but vibration not working. Recommend everyone to buy from Apple Store only.
Can't go wrong with Apple iPhone!,"It's iPhone! Just some battery issues (as always), that's all!"
Excellent phone.,Live up to its brand name.
Five Stars,I loved it
Five Stars,Happy
No Need to Justify...,Apple is one of the best mobile phone everybody knows so no need to justify and product is awesome and delivery is so fast...
Five Stars,Its awesome
A decent overall package,"OS: Stable OS. Note: Android also is stable but in its pure form only.
Build Quality: Good. However, Samsung build quality is the best.
Easy of service: Ok. Again Samsung is better.
Genral solution with Apple is either you replace the screen or the piece. E.g. Fingerprint sensor is not working then replace the entire screen.
OS Support: iOS has better software support in terms of upgrades and security fixes."
Five Stars,Good platform to buy good product
Cheated on warranty,Why i was not given the whole year of warranty??????
Headphone jack not working,The headphone jack is not working in iphone 6s gold.. its just been 20 days and its not working..
good,Purchased from EasyBuy-SLP. good seller and satisfied with this purchase .
Beware of Amazon,Duplicate product. Phone hardly work for a week then it got dead ans also not getting support from Apple service centre for this product.
its ok,Phone me spot h
Superb phone,Awesome
One Star,Fault product...
Thumbs up!!,Original phone. The product packaging was great! Got at a good price!! What can you expect more??
Awesome.... please go and buy this deal...,"This is actually good. Delivery was good and the product inside was brand new. On the back there is also self declaration of is mentioned which is now compulsary for all the electronic products in India. All the accesories are present in the box and not checked the charger and the earphones (As i have an extra old set), but i hope that they are in eorking condition too.
Thanks Amazon and the seller too."
iPhone 6s a very good phone to buy even in 2017,"As we all know IPhone 6S is a very good Product, i Feel the same while using it, it does not consume must battery as the android Phone does and no unnecessary apps in the background."
Excellent mobile,Excellent mobile. It's looks and functions are simply superb. I don't feel that I have spent the money. It feels like an investment.
Review from an android user,"I hv been using Andriod phones and hv always used flagships, wanted to buy a secondary phone so thought for a change.. phone itself has been very good.. confirmed frim apple support that phone was genuine and warranty started on the day I received it and when I activated it. Was delivered at committed time. Experience jas been good so far except for few features that I miss from Andriod but bot a deal breaker. I might continue with iphone in future depending on the reliability of this one. No hangs or problems with the phone functionality so far"
Apple Best Performance oriented iPhone,"Why should you care about the iPhone 6S?
Its a phone that is similar when compared with its sibling the iPhone 6 but hey its not the same device its an another iPhone but in the same clothing
what is all about the iPhone 6S..?
its a phone that has the same chassis as the famous iPhone 6, but hey the phone is not at all the same this is known as 6S comes with some unique colour like Rose gold, just not the color this iPhone has a feature like 3D touch which is again a patent unique to apple iPhone only you wont get to see this features in any other smartphone, other than that it comes with the best camera 12MP i-sight camera which is one of the best in its category even after this device is two year old but everyone wants to buy it there are no changes but still everyone wants to own one this is the magic of Apple.
It also gets an bigger battery which makes this device last longer and due to the A9 processor the battery has surely improved making this device faster than Before this surely makes this device a perfect buy in 2017 if you want to have smart looking iPhone device this should be your choice it also looks pretty neat then the latest iPhone 7 and there are no much big differences between both the device this phone will outperform all those big size android smartphones, this can surely be your cup of cake, if you are tired using those android device and want to come to iPhone family, and have a budget that of iPhone 6s guys then this is the right choice for you, you are getting a balance specification which comes with iPhone 7 and, this part is lovely.
Today owing This iPhone is just like driving a BMW where quality matters the most, One advice i would like to give to all those who are reading this if you have finalized getting this iPhone make sure you wait for this June end as there can be a price drop in coming months which can save you some amount after the launch of iPhone 8.
Even getting this phone at this price will surely make your day once you start using it,
I hope this review helped you if it did please do click YES."
Top notch product,Very good product & nice discounts offered by Amazon.Battery life is on bit lower side compared with other android phone.
A worthy successor to the 5S,"It's hard to write reviews about iconic, and commercially successful products, like the iPhone, because it is unlikely that we will be able to find something to write - that has not already been written about.
Nonetheless, the perspective of a rating changes, when the price-point of a product changes.  The fact that the 6S is today available at a price at which the 5S used to be sold 2 years ago, does make one look at this phone differently.
For those (like me) who are loyalists of timeless & classic design masterpieces from Nokia (N-Series, Lumia 9XX), Apple (5-series), and HTC (One-series) the iPhone 6/7-series design changes were a sacrilege, that tantamount to succumbing in to mass-market needs.  However, look beyond that, and the iPhone 6S is still as beautifully crafted as all iPhones are, and it is hard to find any flaws per se.
And for those of us, who care more about what's under the hood, rather than the shell, the relative price difference between the 6 and the 6S is worth it.
Personally, I like the marginally thicker design of the 6S, as it gives the phone some much-needed heft, as well as the necessary psychological reassurance of eliminating any fears of Bendgate, that battered the iPhone 6's image.  Build quality and craftsmanship continue to be top notch.
The improvement in responsiveness & performance is evident, especially if you are upgrading from a 2-year old 5S, as is the improvement in the quality of the Retina display.  I also think that the form factor of 4.7&#34; screen strikes the right balance between readability & usability; and is therefore another step in the right direction.
The higher resolution front-facing camera is a much-needed fix for today's selfie-obsessed generation, and irons out one of the key weaknesses of the old phone.
Needless to say, the increase in RAM to 2GB, is also reassuring, as it increases the perceived life of the phone, given that apps will continue to become more & more memory intensive.  Not that 1GB RAM was ever inadequate for the 5-series, because the beauty of iOS (like Windows Phone) lay in the fact that it is, by design, a far more resource-efficient Operating System, when compared to Android.
On the whole, a worthy buy for those who don't care much about flaunting the latest & biggest, especially at the price-points it is now available at.
And yes, most women, like my wife, will tend to like the Rose Gold variant :-)"
The best phone ever,The best phone ever! Bought it from amazon for probably the lowest price ever ! Have been an apple user for the past 5 years ! The best in all aspects
Honest Review !!,"Honest review of this amazing phone after 10 days of usage.
The build quality of this phone is amazing.

The Camera takes stunning pictures in low lights as well.
Battery lasts for about 12 hours of intense usage.
Black color looks gorgeous.Go for it.

Five Stars,Fantastic
Very nice product. Original Apple,"Very nice product. Original Apple. I was really breakING my head to go for android or IOS as android is user friendly. I was aboit to ider 1+ 3T but ordered this to give a try. Upto my surprise it corrected by wrong thinking. No wonder why the whole world die after Apple products. What an experience. One can't tell what is so great it until they use it. EXPERIENCE !! U can't get that rich feel no matter how much ever costly phone u use in Android. If u r confused to move android to IOS or fro android to android,  go get an IOS. U will be amazed. Take my word !"
Love it,Amazing phone. Delivery and packaging also nice.
I am loving my iPhone 6s .,Best product for ever. Nice outlook. beautifully designed.
Awesome phone user experience,I don't wanna say anything about the price but I am using this phone for a year now believe me I am completely satisfied with it and the care is very helpful they got my iPhone replaced just because of lagging problem it gave me the experience no android phone did so if u can invest his kind of money It  will withstand ur expectations go  for it feel free to ask any thing about it
Accessories missing,"Got a product without accessories.
Not expected from such a brand name Organization."
iPhone experience,"I got this as gift from amazon in maharaja sale that is why not showing as verified purchase.
This is the first time I am using iOS and I have always been using android phones. My serious advice to you first of all is that be very sure you want an iPhone before making a switch because android users will find that iOS is pretty restricting and not as customizable and feature packed as android. I have been using it for two days and already feeling the frustration of a lot of missing features. A lot of basic tasks require one or two extra steps in iPhone that can be done with a single click in android.
That being said iphones have superior build, better resale value and higher security so over all they are good if you are willing to spend so much for a phone. The camera is definitely way better than anything I got on any of the high end android phones I used. Compared to App Store reviews in google play, the apple App Store seems pretty deserted as far as reviews and activities on Indian apps is concerned.
Over all I have mixed feelings about making the switch to apple. It will take more time getting used to. If you are a typical google fanboy or girl and use a lot of android features then I suggest you don't go for iPhone, android has way better variety in market.
As for the phone itself, nothing much to say except you get what you pay for. It is a beautiful and sleek phone with excellent performance. No heating or hanging issues whatsoever. Charging is blazing fast as well compared to my android phones. It was a big investment and I hope I will be delighted by the iPhone experience in due time."
mic does not work. how could we call it a phone before calling it an iphone,I believed an iphone is an iphone and that's it but was shocked to have a faulty one where the mic is not working. Its not a china mobile and that's the reason i invested such price in it believing it takes that price to earn it but now i am not sure if i did right.
Five Stars,Value for Money
Received defective piece,"Speakers is defective not working properly ,  i checked speaker is not working , I restart 3 4 times then the speaker start works , but volume like 10% of as compared to my friends iphone same model"
that's what I like about apple products,"Smooth as hell, that's what I like about apple products."
Chinese phone instead of apple iphone 6s,"I never seen such a pathetic services.i ordered Iphone but i got chinese from having android app when open ,instead of apple store.
I will give zero star and recommend not to use this app.Now this is the intigrity issue of amazon image."

Review by a first time ios user . I used samsung galaxy s6 edge earlier and many more other android phones.,A must by phone. There r many android devices available such as one plus 3T with high specs but this is very awesome.The best smartphone till now.U will find it ever better than iphone 7 because apple removed airpods and all in iphone 7. Also battery backup is very good than any other android device.
Defective product delivered,A faulty product is delivered with the speakers not working and the phone is heating up even without use. No replacement available.horrible service by amazon n product by cloud tail

Faulty Charger with and expensive phone,We buy expensive product because we want peace of mind.. but never happens in India. online shopping standards are the worst in the world. with iPhone6S I have received a faulty charger... Now I will have to run after iphone care...or initiate return. whats the point of ordering first.. waiting for the product.. initiating return and wait again... and perhaps repeat the same process again...

Five Stars All the Way,Very prompt and fast delivery of a quality product. Can't have hoped for a better purchase experience. 100% genuine and comes with the seller-registered one year Apple India warranty.
Good phone,"Good phone but over priced, perfect screen size, marvellous display, Bluetooth has issue with my car. Battery ok ok, accessories as good as ever."
Best mobiles,"Got in perfectly working condition ...perfect mobile in terms of speed ,camera,apps,battery backup.but packing should have been better...nice experience with the seller."
"If its not an iPhone, it's not an iPhone.","There is little that I can say here about this beauty! The iPhone 6s is currently the best budget iPhone that you can get your hands on.
It's been 4 days since I've been using this and I've only charged it twice. I use a good amount of internet for emails and research.
The camera is just pure fun. It's feature packed and does the job better than most of the other counterparts out there.
Switching from Andriod. I had my doubts. But the iOS is just a sheer pleasure to use. It's so simple yet incredibly effective! It's intuitive and makes your life really easy while working with the phone.
For the price it is available right now, this is a must buy if you are considering buying a phone.
Will post more updates when I've used it longer!
And last but not the least... Thank you Amazon for the prompt delivery. Received the item one day before the estimated date! Simply brilliant!"
Five Stars,I got this phone at the best price with my choice of color

Five Stars,Awesome?
Thanks,Really Good and oreginal product
"Wonderful experience,on Amazon","Amazing,Fully satisfied.Thanks"
... will be in parts Product_ it in itself is good. The touch working speed is good,"It will be in parts
First THERE IS NO RETURN POLICY OF APPLE PRODUCTS ON AMAZON. YOU WILL HAVE TO VISIT SERVICE CENTER AND GET THAT IN WRITTING AND PRODUCE IT TO AMAZON FOR FURTHER PROCEEDURE
Product_ it in itself is good. The touch working speed is good. Primary Camera is good though in secondary camera retina flash doesnt have much impact. Battery is an issue. I used on wifi for preparing my phone charged fully before starting. I downloaded backup from cloud store and well only 23 percent was left. Backup included gmail, photos, apps(5 in all) and yes software update also. I just bought it for a change from 4 inches. But if u ask me iphone se is a fine option until you want 6s only.
Packaging was good and so was delivery. Got within 3 days considering the originating point and my place are on two extremities. The phone was in perfect condition when arrived.
Special mention of mr kenneth the customer care executive for helping me with an issue. My best wishes for his endeavours."
Sad to see the quality expected from amazon and apple ...,The phone i recieved has a defective  speaker and so is difficult to hear . Sad to see the quality expected from amazon and apple not being met.
Genuine Product with all Original accessories :),"Received Genuine Product with all Original accessories, delivery a bit late but totally happy with the product.

Five Stars,tooo much better
Five Stars,Very nice
Pathetic Quality Product,"Dear Team, Product is really pathetic in use. I really want to return this product as the screen of the phone is freezing again and again. Even i am not able to pick up call. I am really not satisfied with the product even after spending 41k rupees."
Don't think twice before buying!,"iPhone 6S, launched back in 2015 is still a beast today. It's one of the most  fastest, snappiest and the premium mobile phones available today. It's miles ahead of the iPhone 6 in terms of technology, hardware and performance, and on par with even the iPhone 7 (it doesn't have the matte black and jet black variants though).
*Pros*:
1. You will the best user experience with the iOS. Only the Google Pixel can match it in terms of UI design and software performance.
2. The camera is phenomenal. It takes the most natural photos and has super quick autofocus.  The front camera takes good selfies in low-light as well. You can shoot 4K videos, although without optical image stabilisation, it's a bit difficult.
3. The 2nd Generation Touch ID fingerprint scanner is the fastest in any phone. All you have to do is rest your finger on the home button and it unlocks.
4. It's great for multitasking. With the 2 GB RAM and the A9 chip, you can have at least 15 different apps open and the phone won't lag or stutter for a second.
5. It's great for playing games, whether you're playing casual games or playing heavy console-level stuff.
*Cons:*
1. The battery is just okay. On most days, you'll get 15-18 hours on medium usage. Although on heavy usage days, you may need to plug it in once in the evening.
2. The design seems a but outdated now. With phones like Galaxy S8 coming out, Apple needs to refresh their design.
3. Photography is not great in low light. It's still better than most phones available in the market, but you won't be satisfied.
And that's it! You'll feel complete with this phone. iPhone 6S compliments you in every imaginable way. So, don't think twice before buying!"
Amazon delivery service is awesome.,No words needed!!!!!! Because it's an IPhone. Amazon delivery service is awesome.

Really bad experience. I am stuck,"I received the phone on 27th and wanted to return on 4th April. The speakers of the phone dont work properly and I intended to to return it back. Neither speaker-mode nor handset mode nor headphone modes are working. The voice is so jittery and poor irrespective of the SIM type and network. I tried the phone with all possible SIMS ... Airtel, Jio, Idea . But I have been told to contact apple not amazon to do so even though I am eligible for return till 6th April. They say its their policy with apple. Why didnot they tell me this while buying the phone? I am stuck now so awfully. People have been warning me not to buy from amazon but I did not heed to their warnings and believed amazon. I was feel really angry and disappointed with the way the situation is being handled."

Coo genuine product,Awesome phone. If you are expecting that it is fake then you are wrong. It's a 100% genuine apple product with proper invoice. Good camera good touch. 3D Touch is somewhat unused as for me. Overall if your budget permits you must go for it.

Joke of the year,WTF???????
Its not a fake iphone,This iphone 32gb iphone 6s is about to replace the 16 gb from the iphone 7 launch date. There wont be any iphone 6s 16gb manufactured here on by apple. The reason for the low priced 64 gb iphone 6s is that they are old stock.
Its so stupid,Dont buy
Four Stars,"People commenting that iPhone 6s 32GB does not exist, should kindly update themselves."
Excuse Me Please,Hello sir excuse me there is no 32gb variant in iphone 6s..
One Star,illogical pricing.. 64 gb @ 48k 32 gb @ 50k
Bit expensive but worth it.,Best phone in its class. Well what can I say you either have &#34;The iPhone&#34; or one of many cheap chinese toys.
