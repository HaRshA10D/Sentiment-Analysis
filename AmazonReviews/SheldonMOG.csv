Excellent novel.,Sidney Sheldon is the most powerful author. Excellent novel.
Intrigue,"Very good, liked it from the first page.  Families are often cruel, a life follows fiction.  Like Sidney Sheldon, his stories always have glamor, death and betrayal.."
A1 writing,"As is typical with all Sidney Sheldon books, this is a page turner as well. You get so close to the characters you feel as if you're part of the story. Great read!"
Couldn't put it down,Good book filled with suspense leaving you guessing...couldn't put the book down. Sidney Sheldon is indeed the master of his game!!!

Five Stars,Great book!!
Five Stars,An epic masterpiece!  What a page turner.
Great for Speed Demons and Leisurely Readers,"This was the first time I've ever read a Sidney Sheldon novel, and it was just what I needed. I'm usually the type to shred through a novel in little more than a couple of days, but I just never seemed to be ready for this story to end. I wound up reading 5 to ten pages here and there, while I was brewing coffee or waiting for an appointment, with the occasional indulgence of several chapters over lunch or before bed. This is the perfect book for speed readers and page nibblers alike. The story spans several generations, with Sheldon introducing and developing new characters along the way. It was easy to lose hours at a time to the swift plot line, but the 360 degree storytelling also allowed me to feel fully satisfied even if I could only fit in a few pages here or there. Accompany the flexible pacing of the book with a killer narrative about power, struggle, and the truth behind coming from &#34;a good family&#34; --- all revolving around strong (if slightly one-dimensional) female protagonists  ---and you're set for a great story.
**Some readers are more mature than others, but the sexuality, violence, and overall &#34;foregone era&#34; theme of this book would probably keep me from recommending this book to anyone under a VERY mature high school student."
Five Stars,love it
Five Stars,EXCELLENT!!!!
Awesome read.,5th time reading over the years ans it's still a page turner!!!  Awesome read.
Three Stars,Eh.

Best book of all time!!!,"This is the best book ever! I highly recommend getting this book if you have never read it before. It is long, but the story is so intriguing that it is hard to put it down. They also made a movie out of this, but the movie cuts out many scenes from the book that would have been great to see."

Five Stars,Great beach or plane read! Complete nonsense and silly sex. Flew through it. But I also loved it.
Very interesting,It's the second time I'am reading this book. The whole tale with all its twists and turns keeps one on the edge of his seat.
Very ouestionable on geographic and political facts !,"Being South African, Sheldon made it very clear that his researh on South Africa is falling very short of the real facts ! He still however remains a master story teller."
Incredible book,Can't keep the book down.  Sounds so real

Four Stars,Excellent
"It's a gripping story, start to finish. It ...","It's a gripping story, start to finish. It paints a graphic picture of South Africa a hundred years ago and how hard the adventurers had to work to find the precious diamonds. Some succeeded, many didn't."
Amazing!,"If you love books with twist, deception, and family, you've come to the right place. This book is like watching the greatest chess match ever played--with human pieces!"
Five Stars,Great

Five Stars,Awesome story!!
Five Stars,Great product great price would recommend
A gift,He's hooked on this author. Read them too fast.
Loved it!!!,A good read. I first read this book in my teens. My daughter was looking for a good  book and I remembered this story. Good from beginning to the end.
It was as good as I remembered,I read this many years ago. I recently thought about it and decided to re-read. It was as good as I remembered.
Five Stars,I enjoyed this book very much and I would highly recommend it
Five Stars,great read.  surprise ending
I am beyond disappointed with this book,"There is only one character in this book that is not one-dimensional, and its Kate, and even she lacks the necessary depth. everyone else exist only in a name. I feel that this book would need to be at least twice as long to develop the necessary plots and twists that would explain some decisions made by the characters. He takes two pages max to go over the Bouer War, WW1 and WWII, which I find completely ridiculous. Three years in a SA camp that Margaret spent took all of one page. really? 0 suffering is described. I am beyond disappointed with this book. and overall this book is unbelievable, literally. So much nonsense doesn't happen even in the Kennedy clan."
Great book. Compelling reading,Great book.  Compelling reading.  Wished I'd read it before the &#34;others&#34;.
An entertaining saga.,"While a bit convoluted at times, and too conveniently handled at times, the story kept my interest and provided a great cast of villians.
Eve received her just desserts.  Unfortunately, Gran Kate never learned her lesson.  Thankfully, Alexandra finds her HEA.
For the most part, I enjoyed reading Master of the Game."
Sidney Sheldon is one of my favorite,I am really enjoying this book.  Sidney Sheldon is one of my favorite authors
Rollercoaster Ride of Greed and Betrayal,You never know what is lurking around the corner in this story! Fast-paced and entertaining. Kate Blackwell is a formidable opponent.
A good read,I was recommended to read this by a friend and I can't put it down. Sidney Sheldon has written many books; but this one is my first time. A very good read!
The best books keeps the reader engrossed till the,One of. The best books keeps the reader engrossed till the end
Like a box of chocolates,"Like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get.  So many people you love to hate, so many surprises.  Love these older books that somehow slipped by me.  I read one morning until 4am because I had to find out what was going to happen.  How can an author's brain work like that?"
Awesome!,This book is by far one of the best books I've read.  You won't be able to put it down .
ivana,"Ivana
Not one of his best books
Would not recommend if one  has read his prior books
 Confusing at times"
Five Stars,Great read!
Excellent reading,I loved this book. I read it years ago and I enjoyed it even more the second time around! Masterful
Five Stars,very good and came in a tmely manner
Excellence in storytelling,"Enough twists, turns, end tension to please any reader.  Sheldon has done it again.  A final victory for the innocent"
Love Sidney Sheldon,One of his best works! The story line moves at a fast pace and keeps the reader turning the pages. The ending leaves you wanting more of the story.
it he decided he wanted to read it & he too loved it. Fast moving & just plain enjoyable,"I read this book years ago and told my husband, it he decided he wanted to read it & he too loved it.
Fast moving & just plain enjoyable. Love, deceit, humorous, sad, wrapped in one book  that is fast easy reading."
Five Stars,My really enjoys reading the Sideny Shedlon
Five Stars,This was one of the books by Sidney Sheldon you did not want to put down.
Five Stars,Great book!
Five Stars,Another masterpiece by Sheldon
Best Of The Best,Beat book I've ever read
Five Stars,Great book.  A must read
Same old stuff,"Sidney Sheldon has found a formula for his novels and he is sticking to it. That is why so many of his fans read his books. I selected the book because I was looking for a novel with his flavor, but i didn't want to waste time reading the same old stuff and I did. This time, he went on and on for hundreds of pages describing generations of the same beautiful, strong willed women, and the handsome men who are rich beyond belief. This is the ""Other Side of Midnight"" and so many other of his books all over again. I wish the author would write a book about a heroine who was less attractive and who had to do something other than get pregnant with Mr. Wonderful's child in order to make something of herself."
This is definitely the old Sidney Sheldon masterpiece. It ...,This is definitely the old Sidney Sheldon masterpiece.  It kept me up late at night turning the pages and waiting to find out what happens next.  It  is well written and suspenseful until the last page.
Very interesting captures your attention from page one to the ...,Very interesting  captures your attention from page one to the end.
Can't put it down!!,One of my favorite books ever. Great twists and turns. Could not put it down
Five Stars,an exciting book didn't want to finish it...smile
Five Stars,Thoroughly enjoyed it
Five Stars,Great read.
fantastic! page turner,fantastic ! page turner !
Five Stars,Great read couldn't put it down!
You'll love it!,Great book; great author.
Three Stars,Great beginning but takes a twisted turn as it goes along
Would not recommend!,I really enjoyed the beginning of the book but then it turned into a ridiculous bad soap opera. BAD!
Three Stars,Was purchased as gift. Delivered in poorer condition as stated.
Master of the game,Another Awesome Sidney Sheldon book ... thank you Sidney ... Don't miss out on reading such an interesting and intriguing masterpiece!!!
Gift,This book was also a gift to someone who specifically asked for this book.  He loves Sydney Sheldon.
Five Stars,love it.
Five Stars,It was a book that I couldn't put down once I started reading it!
Five Stars,So wonderful master piece!
Sheldon is a great writer. I especially liked this book,"Sheldon is a great writer.  I especially liked this book.  Of course, I was not happy with the vulgarity.  The story would have been
fine without it.
Martha W. Bowles"
Five Stars,Another novel from this author which I can recommend.
Three Stars,Novel spans decades of master manipulation at its best.
This book is tops. I read it years ago ...,This book is tops.  I read it years ago and again just recently. Although the characters were fictitious much of the history was real.  Sheldon is a real story teller.
I am hoping is as good.,I found this book very hard to put down.  It kept me reading long after I should have stopped for some sleep.  The story keeps you interested and it makes it hard to put down.  I can hardly wait to read Mistress of the Game.  I am hoping is as good.
Four Stars,one of the best book of sidney sheldon.
One of Sheldon's best!,"This book is addictive!  Even after my third read, I could not put it down.  Sheldon was an amazing author."
South African family saga with gripping stories,A saga of a South African family heavily salted with over ambitious characters leading to tragedies and thrilling episodes. Cannot put it down! Watch out for rough dialogue and explicit scenes!
"A very exciting novel moving from poverty to great wealth, enduring many hardships and tragic happenings","Generation after generation of members seeking wealth.  Story begins with one young boy  leaving England for Africa and the
diamond market.  A very exciting novel moving from poverty to great wealth, enduring many hardships and tragic happenings.
Sidney Sheldon knows how to keep the reader with him all the way."
Five Stars,"very good, unable to put book down. would read it again and again"
GREAT READ,Best book i have read. Love it. You can not put it down.
Undeniably the best book by Sidney,Best book ever
Five Stars,A turning pages awesome book
Five Stars,Excellent read!!
Five Stars,THIS WAS ONE OF HIS BEST BOOKS. EXCELLENT
Really terrible book with a lack of depth,Really terrible book with a lack of depth. Characters got more unbelievable and story more ludicrous with the turn of each page. Started out interesting with the diamond trade background but quickly fell apart.
Five Stars,Great book. Lots of action.
and very good.,"Interesting, current, and very good."
more twists than a mountain road,"An entertaining read, lots of interesting characters; but some of the plots are simply over the top! One would have to be very naive to believe the identical Tweens could not be seperated, even though their behaviour generally was like chalk and cheese."
the most captivating book I have ever read,A book that transcends an era.  A completely unbelievable story.  I totally recommend this book  It will. Be  without doubt the best book you have ever read.
Pathetic!,"Pathetic is the word! I bought it after reading many positive reviews but was totally disappointed with the book! Something in me kept saying that this book just can't be by Sidney Sheldon and I kept checking the authors name over and over again! Much to my disappointment, it is by Sidney Sheldon and its one of his worst books! Something about the ruthless, negative characters and the never ending mad rush for power just doesn't tick!"
My favorite book!,"This is my all-time favorite book in the universe -- and that says a lot since I run a book-reviewing site! This book is just deep, suspenseful, about family. Great read!"
good book,"This is a great book, but I think it would have been better if it focused the whole story on Jamie macgregor because the other parts the two sisters, Kate, etc... Seems kinda rushed. It probably should have been expanded and made into a trilogy.  All in all though great read."
"Master of the Game, in my opinion, was the best of Sidney Sheldon.","This story, covering the history of the lives of several generations, could be a true story.  Events and characters are filled out well."
read it and love it,"This is my favorite book....i've read it over and over
Sidney sheldon is also one of my favorite writers
Ok"
best book I've ever read!,This is by far the best book I've ever read! It's a true thriller and keeps you at the edge of the seat. The characters are mesmerizing and you really get to know each of them individually. This is one of Sidney's master pieces! I've read it over 10 times and each time it doesn't fail to keep me guessing. Well done.
Excellent !!!,I have read this book at least 40 times and own several copies in hardcover. I plan on reading it again :))
"Predictible, a little shallo","I became interested when a friend highly recommended the book and when I saw that Sheldon wrote on a lot of old proven tv shows, such as I Dream Of Jeanie, so I actually bought this book, something I seldom do. You can get so many books free and I seldom pay, which kind of hurts for me now.
It kept my interest but disappointed me. I expected more passion, more feeling. I knew the characters would prevail and could guess how they did, and was boringly correct in my predictions. Not that I didn't get a thrill from their deliverance of justice, or punishment of same, but it was predictable, shallow, painted in flat cartoon colors and not that of masterly iridescence, as I had been led to believe the master of the game was capable of producing. So a so-so book, interesting but not captivating and definatly not moving."
Not involving,"When I started the booking I thougt it will be more interesting, but I think the autor lost the base of the history and only did a big effort to complete the numbers of the pages that was enough to complete a book.
It was the first Sidney Sheldon's book that I don't recomend; it is a waste of time.
If you had a doubt, read, for example, If Tomorrow Cames, Are You Afraid of the Dark  or The Other Side of Midnight: all them are breathtaking!"
Master of the Book!!,Sidney Sheldon is a real master at writing stories that have so many twists and turns. This would have to be one of his best books. I have not met anyone that has read this book that hasn't enjoyed it...l loved it
"Definitely, The Master!","Well I have to say, Sidney did not disappoint, although I must say, he gave me quite a scare toward the end of this book. I've always called Sidney Sheldon the Master of Plots, and I call him that for a very specific reason. He is THE MASTER OF ALL MASTERS! How he throws several stories into one and your mind is spinning trying to figure out what the hell is going on, by the time you get to the end and it comes together, you say, &#34;A-ha!&#34; He was such a brilliant writer and Lord knows I miss him. He's one of my favorites and one who made me want to go into writing.
This story was outstanding. Again, near the last few chapters, I got so damn frustrated because those twins, Eve and Alexandra were something else, or shall I say, Eve was something else. The good twin versus bad twin type of vibe going on. Alexandra angered me so much because she was so damn stupid and never saw the wrong in anyone. She was almost childlike, but even children eventually begin to suspect things, but not Alex. Eve, in my opinion, was short for Evil! That woman had some issues for real!
Sidney managed to go through an entire family dynamic in this book. From the ancestors all the way through the early '80s. To follow each generation was amazing. Katherine Blackwell's early beginnings gave rise to how the rest of the family would fair.
The ending was so classic Sidney! It was OUTSTANDING! OMG, I cheered at the end because it was so fitting! If you've never read this, trust me, you will love it! What an Awesome Read!"
Great book.,Loved it ! could not stop reading it. Sidney Sheldon realy knows how to get you engaged with his books.
One of my favorite books that I have ever read.,I have read this book three times.  Sidney Sheldon is a great story teller and keeps you interested.  It is not a long book and very interesting.
Great story,I couldn't put this down. I never head Sheldon's books before and he is a great mystery storyteller. I will read more. Love the kindle books.
Amazing page turner.,"Once you begin reading this book it is impossible to out down.  The pages and the years fly by in a whirl of twists, turns and intrigue."
Fantastic!,"This is the second time I read Master of the Game, and now I have refreshed my memory as to why this has been my favorite book for all these years!"
Action packed with turns in every direction. Hard to stop.,"I thought the story was very good with lots of surprises and my thoughts are. Grandmother will get her way in the end. .
Dislikes: I'M not in the the sexual aspects- I felt there was to much.
Recommend:to all of my friends, however would advise them of my feelings of to much the sex. Not needed to make a great story."
intriguing,Very interesting book. I found it difficult to put the book down after beginning and I am not an avid reader. For a book that will make you want to read more Sidney Sheldon did a great job at keeping me interested for more
My thoughts,"The book was Awesome would highly recommend reading, My husband turned me onto this author so I am now reading more from him."
Sidney Sheldon Fan,Great book. Now I will read the sequel. I couldn't put this one down. Sheldon is one of my favorite male authors. I highly recommend this book.
One of my favorite books!,"Normally I never read a book twice.  However I read this one many years ago and decided to read it again.  I remembered some parts of it, but others parts not at all!  Loved this book the first time I read it and loved it the second time too!  Also, never knew there was a sequel &#34;Mistress of the Game&#34;, so I read it too.  It was not as good as the first book, but I still enjoyed it."
masterful,"One of my favorite authors. Money, power, sex, war, the language. Just a wonderfully executed plot and series of events. 495 pages you'll read in 1 day"
very good read,"l stop reading for awhile because l could not find a book that was interesting enough, Master of the game has given back my enjoyment of reading again. Looking forward to more of his books."
Truly captivating! A story that just kept on building...,It captured my interest from page one and I just kept on reading... It took me two days and one sleepless night to devour the book!
Good twists and turns,"I enjoyed re-reading this book. Since Sheldon died and the books are on Kindle, I am liking re-reading some of the books I enjoyed at another time and have the opportunity without having to carry heavy books around. This is one of his earlier, I think. He is a master story teller and develops his characters and the story well. It takes place mostly in South Africa during and just after Aparthied. It is a family saga that traces the diamond trade and then the corporate trade being built from nothing to a global conglomerate. Kate is facinating and her story of power, intrigue and love is full and rich. I would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys family sagas. Read this before Mistress of the Game"
time to read this book again!!!,"I read this book probably 20 years ago in paperback then I recently bought it in kindle!!  I was amazed how thoroughly enjoyable it was to read again. I also bought The Godfather 
The Godfather (Signet)
by Mario Puzo on kindle and read it again as well as The Firm 
The Firm: A Novel
by John Grisham - if anything all three of these books were even better and more enjoyable. Maybe because I'm now in less of a hurry."
Wonderful read!,I could not put it down. Read entire book in two days. Keeps reader interested at all times. Highly recommend.
Not my cup of tea.,This book was way too dark for me.  The violence ruined what could have been a good story.  Read at your own risk.
Read it.  You'll like it.,"Good story.  Keeps moving along.  Typical Sidney Sheldon.  Sometimes the situations are a bit contrived but if you are reading for enjoyment, Sidney Sheldon always comes through"
Great story,This book caught me from the first page and I didn't want to put it down. From diamonds in Africa to four generations later in New York.
A greed based Empire with an interesting cast of characters...,"How many lifetimes can be inside one book? I lost count. Yet the diversity of the characters portrayed was amazing. A book that seizes your attention and overflows with trdegedy, greed, dispare, love and even a little gerosity thrown in to wet your appetite for more. Loved the book..."
This is my favorite book,"First I want to say that the story is absolutely amazing. Not only is it propelled thought pages but it does it with an amazing sense of emotion & logic, all mixed & prepped.
I love how it moves thought a few different time eras. I had never seen this done before, though I'm sure it isn't new, it certainly blew me away.
It's just an amazing story & I even wish I could lead a similar life."
Great Read,Was a re-read for me from many years ago.  Loved it then and loved it now.  Sidney Sheldon at his best !!!  A real page turner.
Best Mystery Ever!,"This is the second time I have read this book. It has been years since the first time. I have read all of Sidney Sheldon' s books and this is my favorite. There are always twist and turns that  you don't expect. I always think I will figure out the next one and he gets me every time.
I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book they can't put down. I really miss this Author."
Master of teh game,"This book has the typical Sydney Sheldon action and the Kindle can not be put down before you have finished the book
 It has all the action that a person expects from Sheldon and he can continue publishing such books
 Barry
Kleinmond
SouthAfrica"
Master of the Game,"Sidney Sheldon writes an exceptionally good book.  My son teases me that I love her books because they are about powerful women in the world.  That may be so, but I also find them very entertaining."
Tha story is a very good example of fiction novel. once you start raeding it you will not like to put it down untill you finish,"I would say I like every aspect of the whole story. It give a good account of what a determined mind could achieved despite all odds in in which human-beings could find him or herself be it in business ,love relationships, politics or any under-world business.It discusses different cultures of one part of a continent to another, for an example, South Africa, Scottish, Danish and America.It reveals the manipulating skill of an intelligent feminine gender. I would like to recommend to any other reader that may have not read it before to check it out.
."
"exciting story, attractive characters","I enjoyed it so much. This is a page turner, you can not put it down until finish reading.I am looking for next one from his works."
great read,"Enjoyed it a lot. However, I was expecting a little more from the final part, but it's definitely worth it!"
Master of the Game.,"Rcvd. This as a hardcover several years ago and had lost it in travels somewhere. Rcvd. as a Christmas gift. Was slightly disappointed until it was time to go to sleep. I picked up the book, read the epilogue, read the 1st chapter and ended up I could not put the book down and I read the whole entire thing that night. When I was asked about it the next day, I told them that I had read it. They were under the impression that I had that book before. I corrected by letting them know that I had stared from beginning and read it to end it last night. This is a book you cannot put down. It's intriguing and it keeps you wanting to know more. I saw the movie, and it was JUST like the book. I could not stop watching the movie. It was over it the course off two nights and was very disappointed when I had that I had to wait until the following night. A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE WHO LIKES MYSTERY!!!!!"
Great read!,"Fast-paced, intriguing, full of twists and turns.  Hard to put down and constantly changing.  One of the more interesting books I've read in awhile."
Love his books!,"It's been years since I have read anything by Sidney Sheldon, and I had forgotten how delightful his stories are. I will be looking forward to reading the conclusion that I understand that Tully Bagshawe has written. Since I enjoy her work too, it should be great."
Favorite Book Ever!,"Just reread this for the first time in 20 years.  Yes, still my favorite book ever!  I think I'll read it again in 20 years :)"
Awesome,This is a great book and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is just like all the others he writes.
excellent book,good book with a few unexpected turns. Sidney Sheldon usually put out a very good product. would recommend this book.
Absolutely intriguing,"I think this is Sheldon's best.  The story is compelling and absolutely a book that you can't put down!  This is the first Sidney Sheldon book I read, and after this one, I went on to read eight more of his books."
Sidney Sheldon 's the master of the game,I read this book twice more than a decade ago. It just crossed my mind & it's still an excellent read. Everybody should experience this book as well as this author!
Master of the Game,The story very predictable - I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who would like to read a book that keeps your interest throughout with a great story line.
Never Disappoints!,"No matter what book I pick up by Sidney Sheldon, he never disappoints!  Twists and turns and oohs and ahs always!"
Fabulous,I Don't know where Ive been but I have just discovered Sindey Sheldon. What a fabulous author!!! This book is great and I look forward to reading ALL of his books!!!
Standing ovation...cheers...applause!,"I first read &#34;The Other side of Midnight&#34; many years ago and thought it was outstanding.  I just finished reading &#34;Master of the Game&#34; and it was absolutely outstanding.
Plot twist and turns that leave your mouth agape...clever writing, unscrupulous characters...this book has it all and it is one fast moving page turner.  OUTSTANDING!!!
Am on to my next Sidney Sheldon book."
Exciting,I read this book many years ago & loved it!! It was just as exciting & thrilling a mystery the 2nd time. I am glad I bought it & can enjoy it again later!! Sydney Sheldon is one of my favorite mystery writers!!!
LOVE IT!!,"This has been my favorite book since High School. I could read it a hundred times. It NEVER gets old. If you would enjoy reading about a wide eyed innocent travel half way around the world to slave in the diamond trade, this is the book for you. After nearly dying and making his claim, he is beaten and left for dead, while the vultures eat at his flesh. Luckily, a dear friend finds him, mends him, and helps him plot his revenge."
Fastmoving & spell binding,Great book.............story kept me interested all the way through the book. I have now added this author to my favorites.  I will continue to read his books.
Not what I expected,"I bought this book for a friend, and the condition it came in was not the type that you give to someone else. I do not feel that it matched the description accurately. It was dirty, old, ripped and stained."
Master of the Game,"Although I was told it was new, I was not told it was the version which was not the original published one.  It was from a book club which is much smaller in size and therefore, not what I was looking for."
Good read.,All his books are good.  I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.  I liked it went through generations so some real body to the story.
Outstanding author!,"Having read this book many years ago, I decided to buy it and read it again,  It was outstanding both times around. Mr. Sheldon has a way of captivating his audiences throughout his novels."
Very 80's.,"I won't deny that Sheldon is a born story teller, but the story is very 80's era - everyone is impossibly rich and beautiful -- and he has a tendency to foretell events before they happen making the outcomes, for me, a little ho-hum. I read this book on the recommendation of several people whose opinions I respect -- or should say respected. Don't think I'd commit to another Sheldon."
A great story and wonderful read,Story line moves along at the perfect pace. Interesting characters you can &#34;see&#34;. Nobody is better than this than Sheldon. A shame that he's no longer around.
A fun fast read.,"This is a book to read in between  a series or  a trilogy, sort of like a snack before a big main meal."
Not much character development but an easy read,"I found the oddest thing about this book was that its pace was so fast that a terrible tragedy could happen to a character and then a couple of paragraphs later s/he was over it and moving on with their lives.  Because it covers a period of about 100 years, events are just skimmed over, characters are not developed and as a result, there's very little emotional engagement with the story.  I wouldn't read another book by the same author based on this one.  Having said that, its an easy read and enjoyable enough, just a bit empty and soulless."
Very Pleased with the condition of the book,I was very pleased in the condition of this old classic.  I bought it for a friend who is a collector of Sidney Sheldon and she cried when she opened the bag.  Also like the timeline of the delivery.  Thanks
I'm glad I read it.,"It's very informative of the diamond history in Africa.  The characters became irritating as the generations went on, nevertheless it's a good read."
Interesting,I would recommend this book to all. It was interesting from start to finish and i could not put it down.  Will be buying the sequel.
Master storyteller,I have read this book twice and I think I'm ready for a third time.  This quite literally is the best piece of fiction that I have ever read!!
Worth the second read,"This is a fantastic story that I could read a third time, one of Mr. SHELDON's best, this is a master piece"
very GOOD,"Love his books very f a st reading, always makes you want to get a mother book of his ..."
Master of the Game by Sidney Sheldon,Picked up this book on Saturday and did not put it down until Monday. A must read and OMG did I learn some things
A Must Read According to My son,My son is a Sidney Sheldon fan and wanted me to read this.  I was not as thrilled with it as he was.
Wow,"This book held me from start to finish.  My boyfriend recommended it to me and I didn't hesitate, I'm glad he mentioned it to me.  The twists and turns and the moments of total shock kept me on my seat.  Great book!"
Master of the Game,For me this book was very hard to get into and so I never finished it. I was disappointed in this book. It did not live up to Sidney Sheldons writting.
Lekker,"Another awesome Sidney Sheldon book. Couldn't put it down. Nice plots and twists. I'm buying the sequel, Mistress of the Game NOW."
Master of the Game,"Typical Sheldon...keeps your attention and surprises you. A good story spread over several generations, which can sometimes lose the reader. Loved it."
Master of the Game,"IN LOVE with this novel, I have read it more than 10 times, it's one of the main reasons I started reading, it's one of the can't put down till your done books. I highly recommend this to anyone. It have everything..."
Nobody Can Tell a Story Like S.Sheldon,"I would recommend this book to anybody that likes to read and also those that don't.
Once you turn the first page you can't put it down."
Fave!,This book was a great read. My favourite Sidney Sheldon to date. Finished it in one day I was totally consumed
Story writing at its best,"I downloaded a sample of this book as the South African element interrested me. The history of the Diamond and Gold rush was fascinating and I could relate to the tough heat of the summer and cold of the winters . The story takes you from the 1800 hundreds to modern day and spans three generations . From Rags to Riches , its worth the read.
I have purchased the follow on to this book"
A Must Read,"I Could Not Put This Book Down, Master OF The Game Is By Far The Best Book I Ever Read"
Struggle,The book took to long to come to it's conclusion. It was unnecessary and at times fairly boring. It was by far the most disappointing Sidney Sheldon book I've read.
Master,Great book. Could not have put the book down for a second!!! I can't wait to read his other books
A MUST READ!!!!!,"This book is absolutely splendid! This is my very first book of Sidney Sheldon but it won't be my last. This book had so many twist and turns That I found that I was unable to stop reading! There is history, romance, thrill, murder and unbelievable excitement!!! I LOVED IT!!!"
Another good one...,Another good one .... I have read all the Sydney Sheldon books and not one has disappointed yet.....always waiting for the next one to come along.....
Great Read!,"I was first introduced to this book by my dad. He kept saying how good it was and that I should read it. Both him and my mom have read it but in a different language. So I finally got the book on my Google Nexus and finished it within 4 days. It was that good! A great read about family, love, betrayal and success. I've now gotten my boyfriend to start on it. A must read!"
Best Book I ever read!,This is truly master of the game in books.  The best Sheldon book I have read yet & I can't wait until I read it again!!!!
five stars,The best book I have ever read. I can not wait to read Mistress of the Game by Sidney Sheldon.
A Page Turner,Thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  Read it many years ago and it was still a page turner.  Highly recommended for easy and enjoyable reading.
Great book,Spellbinding-I did not want to put this down. I am a big fan of Sydney Sheldon. Looking forward to his next book.
Sheldon is a master storyteller,"I have read every one of Sheldon's novels and they are unique, nothing monotonous, always captivating right from the first page, always spellbinding, and he is being missed very much. RIP Sidney, thanks for the pleasures you have given to a great number of us who love your books."
good book,I read this book over 15 years ago.  Decided to read it again.  this is still a very good book
Sheldon or Steele??,This ridiculous novel reads like a Danielle Steele book. It is brim full of sweeping generalities as to how the wealthy live and is really poorly written.
awesome read,"This is the book that really got me into reading! I love Sydney Sheldon and have
since read every one of his book!"
Excellent Book,I am a novice reader and I am awe struck by the captivation provided by this book. Excellent page turner.
Always enjoy reading Sidney Sheldon.,"Always enjoy reading Sidney Sheldon.  Once you start reading, you don't wanna stop until you're at the last page.  Go Read."
Riveting,"I have the DVD set of this series. I wanted to see how the book compares to the movie. I loved the book more so than the movies. It tied up a lot of ends that were not in the movie. So if you have the movie, read the book also. It was worth the money to get the book."
"Great book, highly recommend!",What a masterpiece...could not put it down!  Sidney Sheldon is the Master of his game!  Can't wait to read another.
Master of the Game,"This book had a lot of intrigue, but the unrevealing should have tied up all the ends.  A bit long, but kept me reading."
Holds your attention from begining to end,I first read this book when I was 12 and I still read it every couple of years. I love the way the story follows the lives of several generations of the family and from all of their POV. GREAT READ!
Storytelling at its best,"Master of the Game is a phenomenal story. This book does not disappoint! Sidney Sheldon takes you on a journey throughout the world, through many different love stories. Each chapter is better than the one before it, thus making it hard to put the book. Furthermore, just when you think the story has reached its peak, Sidney Sheldon shocks you and takes you on an even racier journey than what we started with. It's like being on a roller coaster never knowing when the big drop comes and when it does, you have to pick your jaw up from the ground and pace yourself for more. The book is written excellently well. This is story telling at its best. I didn't want to put the book down and even now I find myself thinking back on Kate Blackwell and her family wishing Master of the Game didn't have to end. It was just simply amazing! If it hasn't been done already, I would love to see this turned into a TV series. I'm telling anyone who can listen to read this book!"
Only Sidney can deliver,"As I was reading this book I was having a hard time putting it down , its a love story,Adventure , twisted , crime , its everything in this book, when I got to the last chapter and getting close to the end I couldnt wait to see the outcome of the story  and then it hit me, I read this book before about 5 years ago funny thing is I still enjoy it and thank for not remembering 99% of it  till I was at the end
Then I say damn I know the ending I read it anyway and refresh my memory ... Overall I love all his book I only read Sidney Sheldon Novel......
Ron"
Typical Sidney Sheldon style!,"This book was a typical Sidney Sheldon novel....GREAT!  He is one of my favorite authors and he never disappoints! I know this is one of his earlier novels, but it is still worth reading.  I could hardly put it down and I'm ready for another suspensful ride!"
master of the game,"I found this book very captivating. I also read the sequel, Mistress of the game and enjoyed that as well."
Awesome book!,Master of the Game is a wonderful book. I could not put it down. I read it twenty years ago and enjoyed it thoroughly the second time around.  It is suspenseful and ruthless at times.  Plenty of good versus evil. I highly recommend Master of the Game.
Best book written,Sidney Sheldon was one of the best writters ever. His writing would take you into the story line. Master of the Game is the book that got me started reading Sidney Shelon books.
Master of the Game,"This is an amazing book about a young man looking to make his fortune in diamonds in Africa.  Sydney Sheldon is an amazing writer who captures your mind and your imagination.  While reading this book, there were times I felt a part of the scenery and the people.  I would recommend and have recommended this book."
Very good,I found it to be a very exciting and intriguing thriller that keep you coming back to the ipad until you finish with it. Typical Sidney Sheldon stuff.
Master of the Game,Very captivating story line in the usual Sidney Sheldon Style. I am looking forward to reading the two other books in this series.
Dissapointed by Most Characters,"Yes, I found this book intriguing, and hard to put down. Still, each character disappointed me individually. I was rooting for Jamie, and he became a cold-hearted creep. I was rooting for Kate, and she became a manipulative witch that ruined lives. I was rooting for Alexandra, and she never became smart-stayed unbelievably naive.  I was out for Eve, and she had a Samson attack--lose her beauty, lose her evil. It was quite frustrating.  I enjoyed the storyline up until a ridiculous lobotomy (does anyone REALLY do that to their kid?!?).  After that it got a bit OTT for me.  Still, there is a complexity to this book that holds it together, and by then you've read so far you may as well finish it--then you'll wish for a different outcome.
If you are looking for a read that will delight and frustrate you, with an extremely powerful and manipulative woman at the helm, than this read is for you."
Awesome read!,"I've always enjoyed Sidney Sheldon books.  This was no exception, loved it!  Family politics at its best, stabbing others in the back, greed, power thirsty people, oh yeah ..."
Excellent,"This is the 3rd time I have read this book in the past 15 years. It will remain a part of my reading collection for life. Awesome story line. Sidney Sheldon is truly the ""Master of the Game""."
the best book you well ever want to reread,i read this book a long time ago and i remeber every thing i have read so there are only a few books worth rereading for me in this world. This is one of them! enjoy!
Two Books In One,"WOW! Like an exhilarating roller coaster ride. Master of the Game is so jammed packed with twist & turns that seamlessly mesh together it could have easily made for two, if not three different books. Short, crisp chapters spanning over 100 years and several generations with each chapter ending with stunning revelations propelling you immediately onto the next chapter. For fun, easy, light-weight entertainment this will be hard to beat."
A Great Sidney Sheldon Book!,This is a book I borrowed from the library many years ago and really enjoyed it. I wanted to read it again and I found a copy on Amazon. You either love or hate the characters Sidney Sheldon puts in his books due to his ability to write strong backgrounds and actions of the characters. A really well written book!
Master of the Game,"Years ago I a friend lent me this book, and I remember thoroughly enjoying it.  I now had the opportunity to purchase it and read it again.  The reason why the book is so good in my opinion is that it covers generations of a family with all their failures and triumphs.  The author is very descriptive and creates full and living characters that one can feel.  A great book for those who like the drama of life and family."
master of the game,Great Book.  I read it 30 years ago and liked it every bit as much as the first time
A  compulsion to acquire money and power,"An interesting tale.  Jamie McGregor leaves a hardscrabble farm in Scotland in 1883 to seek his fortunes in the diamond fields of South Africa, one of many people chasing a dream (my mother's family left Scotland circa 1620, first to Ulster, and then to the American colonies to seek their fortunes).  Jamie's initial success is stolen from him, and he seeks revenge, and then has a compulsion to acquire wealth and position in society.  He passes his compulsion to his daughter Kate, who learns that power matters early in her life.  Kate learns to manipulate people, and force things in the direction she wants, even if she destroys people in the process.  Therein lies the story, because some things come back to bite her.
The story alternates from detailed episodes to fast forwarding that skims over years of intervening time.  There are sections that could have been better researched, e.g., in 1914 Kate talks about building armaments for World War I including tanks for the Army (tanks had not been invented at that point in time).  Overall, it does give a good picture of the racial problems in South Africa where her company was founded, and the exploitation of native labor.  It covers a span of about 100 years starting with her father, then Kate, then her son, then her granddaughters, and finally a young great grandson, ending on Kate's 90th birthday party.
It is an interesting story, but I would not give it five stars.  Perhaps it tries to cover too much in one novel, with too many sub-plots."
master of the game,"I was really pleased with this purchase,this was the first time I ordered a used book, it was described as being in good condition with a few tears on the jacket, and that is exactly how I got it, it looked the way a book of that age would,I received it less than 2weeks after it was ordered. I will definitely do this again."
Master of the Game,"I did not realize that the book was taped on cassettes rather than CDs.
Otherwise, the book was well read, abridged, and accurate.  I bought
it to listen to before I listened to the next book in the sequence."
Master of the Game,"I never received this product, and the money was removed from my checking account. Can anyone tell me who to contact?"
Mistress Of the Game,"I enjoyed this book very much, it is defintely entertaining. However if you get a chance to read Master of the Game 1st do so as this is a sequence of a family saga which I was not aware of and later read the 1st book after Mistress of the Game. I was able to purchase Master of the Game thru Amazon since it is hard to find elsewhere.Master of the Game was 1st published in 1987 and was twice as good!!"
master of the game,"a classic story about the rough diamond trade in Johannesburg and the east cost of Africa - Namibia. A page turner of the first magnitude.  Crawl under the fence to reach the  secoast of Namibia where rough diamonds are lying in the sand, under heavy armed guard where trespassers will be shot on sight...."
"Great book, but too many typos in Kindle version","I really enjoyed the book.  But the kindle version was FULL of typos.  Some so bad that I couldn't even figure out the word.  Most of them I could figure out, but it stops the flow of the reading when you are constantly having to think about a word or the meaning of a sentence.  Regardless, the book was very good.
I did inform Amazon of the problem and hopefully they correct in the future."
Great Story,"All I have to say is read this book! It's a great story I couldn't put it down.  This is the first book I've read by Sidney Sheldon and if the rest of his books capture your attention like this one, I want to read them all."
Master of the Game,"Great book for air travel.  Humorous and suspenseful all at the same time.  Although you might not LIKE all the characters, they are well developed and intriguing.  It's certainly a page turner."
couldn't put it down...,"although I had to, so that I could sleep and do homework... I read this book when I was in high school and then got hooked on sheldon, but then realized most of his books revolve around the same themes, oh wait, that's another review... so anyway, I loved this book, had several characters but the underlying theme of struggling to survive/get ahead despite shady folks is what got me.  the book does span over a few generations, but I thought that was an interesting ""twist""
all in all, a fun read"
couldnt put it down,this is the first sheldon book i've read;  i like cuessler and ludlum - with lots of action.  i found this one interesting and gripping from the beginning.  i'm happy i found a new author to read.
"Fast-Paced, Intrique - One of his BEST","Generally speaking,  Sidney Sheldon moves things along with just the right  amount of intrique.  This is one of his very best (in my opinion) novels.  Easy reading, excellent character development, story moves-so you turn  pages quickly wanting to learn what happens next - and no dissappointments.  When you finish - you just want another good book - try move of Sheldon's  (Rage of Angels) or Stuart Woods books such as - Choke,  Dead in the Water,  and Swimming to Catalina."
