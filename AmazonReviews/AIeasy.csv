Best in AI,"If you truly want to understand Artificial Intelligence completely and in every way, this is the book for you.  The authors are leading experts in the field of AI."
Five Stars,Great in depth explanations of how AI works
Five Stars,"what can I say, it's a book."
Five Stars,It is exactly same content of international edition.
Five Stars,very good!
Five Stars,I am constantly learning from this book and look forward to each next chapter.
A waste of time and money,"The book wastes much space with explanations of the trivial and then leaves a big gap in helping the student to understand how to build algorithms to solve the classic problems.  There are many problems at the end of each chapter, but not even any hints of how to solve them.  There is a set of multiple choice questions and answers at the end of the book; these challenge only the students ability to memorize definitions."
Five Stars,Comprehensive.
Not so good.,"- The cover doesn't match the image on Amazon.
- It was the Indian edition, which was not mentioned in the description at all.
- The book clearly labelled: illegal to calculate outside India
- Indian edition is supposed to be $30, now this seller is selling for $88.
- the book is badly printed on low-quality paper, words fade or gets blurry on quite a few pages."
"The ""Standard"" AI textbook in academia",I'd like to see a 4th edition... the 3rd edition is over 7 years old now.
Five Stars,Great deal!
Five Stars,Required for college
Five Stars,a nice book over all
Five Stars,Everything is there except...it is illegal to pass around this book outside of India...it nerves me.
Four Stars,"Great content, but it's a flimsy book. Be careful or it will fall apart on you."
Four Stars,This is a far-ranging introduction to a number of artificial intelligence approaches and techniques.

Great content but underwhelming experience with kindle format,Formatting for Kindle edition is not at par with other kindle books. It feels like that paper version is represented in kindle format without giving much thought of user experience.
Must for AI,"Seminal work, fills in the core pieces of AI..."
Stay away from the Kindle version!,"The contents of the book are great, but it is unfortunate how bad of a job they did in making the kindle version. The layout is terrible, graphs and pictures of algorithms are blurry and sometimes partly cut off, and a lot of grammar mistakes. Other than that, the book is well written, just not satisfied with the version I bought. Would consider switching to the hardcopy version despite the extra cost and physical weight just because of how terrible the kindle version is."
Easy to understand and contains a wide coverage of modern ...,A textbook for my graduate AI class. Easy to understand and contains a wide coverage of modern AI techniques. Must-read for anyone learning AI.
The authors do a great job of explaining the concepts in language so easy ...,We use this book in our AI introductory class. The authors do a great job of explaining the concepts in language so easy to understand that complete newcomers to AI can understand. Love it.
Three Stars,too heavy to take it with me
Five Stars,awesome!!
Five Stars,love it
Great book !,"Great book ! 1130 pages and yet to the point.  I haven't read the first two editions so i cannot judge if there is a lot of new stuff in this 3th edition, but i feel like i am able to make an expert system myself, having read the book.  Not for the layman though.  You need to have an engineer's or mathematical mind to grasp everything.  The book really covers everything from the neat's point of view.  In the heart, i am a scruffy but what this book has taught me, can certainly do no harm as it is a real overview of all the scientific techniques involved in making expert systems and other applications in AI."
Great intro to AI,"Condensed knowledge on main topics in artificial intelligence, very easy to follow"
Comprehensive and updated book on AI,Very in depth coverage on the field of AI. We used it for our undergraduate intro to AI class but I think the material as presented in the book is graduate level.
excellent book.,"Mint condition, excellent book."
"Paper quality is horrible, but the book content is great.","The book content is great, but the paper quality is really awful. The publishing company is now using newsprint (very low quality)."
Great Introduction to AI,"I purchased this product for my Artificial Intelligence Class. This is a great introduction book to AI algorithms. For a graduating Computer Science, I felt that it presented many examples and algorithms in a simple easy to understand way with great real world applications.
My only complaint with this book is that a lot of the pseudocode is hard to follow and implements a lot of algorithms without any explanation. For a more experienced programmer this may not be a problem, but as a student I found it hard to follow at times. Overall great book!"
Three Stars,The index is quite limited
Nice,Nice
"Good as reference, bad as learning tool","This books covers a TON of topics and provides pseudocode for most of the major algorithms, making it great as a reference text. However, a lot of the explanations are very brief and dense, so it can be pretty hard to learn topics for the first time from this book."
Five Stars,GREAT work
Five Stars,"Perfect, exactly as I hoped it would be!"
Inconsistent detail of psudocoded algorithms,This was required reading for an AI class I took. There are a lot of good examples and descriptions of different algorithms. However there are many parts where psudocode is given in which hypothetical functions are referenced. A decent description of these hypothetical functions is not always provided.
Five Stars,Great version
Not worth the money. Too expensive with hardly any  subject clarity. College Book SCAM. Go purchase international version,Not worth the money. Too expensive with hardly any meaning full subject clarity. College Book SCAM. Go purchase international version for less than $10 instead of $200 on US version..
Five Stars,A classic on the topic!
Five Stars,Cheap!!!!
Great Textbook,"So I'm in a class that requires this text book. So far I have to say they provide good examples and explain he complex parts pretty well. They also add some humor in hear on example which I love. This book is a easy read compared to most text, and the HW question inside the book are fun to answer. This book makes me feel like I'm learning a lot.
Ill update this again once the class is over and I'm farther in the book."
Awful kindle edition,"This review is for the kindle version, not the content. For this much money I'd really expect a better conversion. It is really just a pdf, not a real ebook. You are not able to change font sizes o background colors, they basically did the absolute bare minimum."
Don't buy the ebook,"So far this book is wonderful.  I greatly, greatly wish I had bought the physical book.  The ebook is so, unbelievably bad.  It's basically just a scan of the actual book.  You have no control over the font or the colors.  I have to zoom in just to be able to read it.  It shouldn't be sold as an ebook if this is the quality they are pushing.  The book itself is 5 stars, but the ebook is 1.
If I could return the ebook and get the paperback,  I would."
Five Stars,great?
Four Stars,"Pretty heavy on search-algorithms, but that's a decent approach to AI for most undergrad programs."
Five Stars,"Love this book, is a must have for anyone interested in exploring and revisiting AI techniques. Love it!"
Honestly one of the best courses I've ever taken in my life,Honestly one of the most interesting text books I have ever owned. Bought this for a class my university offered in AI as an elective. Honestly one of the best courses I've ever taken in my life. This book is HUGE btw. It has a lot of conceptual problems it goes over that easily could be a study guide for a LOT of types of job interview questions
Book is in good condition!,Book is in good condition!
Five Stars,Great textbook! I used it in an introductory AI course. Organized and written well
Five Stars,High quality book physically!
Four Stars,A good way to be introduced to the concepts governing artificial intelligence
I've never enjoyed reading a textbook this much,"I've never enjoyed reading a textbook this much. The author has a sense of humor, but still does a great job explaining. I actually look forward to reading this book whenever I can. Great book for jumping into AI."
"Good book, but the Kindle version still needs some work.","As a textbook, it's fine. It covers a wide range of concepts and topics in the field of artificial intelligence and is a good resource to have around.
My rating is mainly based on the state of the Kindle version. There are some issues I have with it that keep me from enjoying it further.
The biggest problem is the overall format. Pages aren't just digital versions of the physical pages in the real book. They're broken up into thousands of screenshot-like segments. You can't scroll &#34;up to the top of a page&#34; or &#34;down to the bottom&#34; because each page segment is only as big as your screen. This would be fine if it were a much smaller book. My tablet counts 33,261 page segments when I use it, so you can see how this might be cumbersome for such a large book.
The effect of the above problem could be reduced a bit if the table of contents were complete. As it is, the table of contents is very limited in what section it allows you to &#34;jump&#34; to. The book is broken up into sections, each of which is covered in a number of chapters, as one might expect. But unfortunately, the Kindle version only lets you jump to the first chapter of each section, not any chapter in the book. This means that you either have to swipe through hundreds of page segments to get to the spot you want, or you can use the slider at the bottom of the screen and hope you land near where you want to be (the slider won't give you any additional info about where you are, either). I suppose you could swipe through it ahead of time and place book marks at each chapter header, but that shouldn't be something a reader has to do to navigate a book by its own chapters.
The only other things I can think to mention have to do with resizing the screen. It's not very smooth at all. In fact, there is usually a noticeable delay when you try to resize a page segment, probably because it has to re-calculate all the page segments to fit the new zoom scale. I'm sure this could be improved if each page were just a digital version of its physical counterpart. The other problem is that the images in the book do not resize with the text. This is an especially troublesome problem for this particular book, since there are a number of intricate diagrams and images of pseudo code algorithms that are very difficult to read at this size. I can't even read some of them, and my tablet screen is larger than 10 inches.
This is actually the second Kindle book I've purchased. The first one (Introduction to the Theory of Computation, by Michael Sipser) was near flawless. Each page was a digital representation of its physical counterpart, the table of contents was complete, and resizing was very smooth. I bought this AI book in Kindle form hoping for a similar experience, but I guess not all the kinks have been worked out yet. It honestly comes off feeling like a beta version that isn't quite finished. But given my experience with that other Kindle book, I know improvements can be made to this one.
All that being said, I can still use the Kindle version of this book. It's just very inconvenient. If you're looking to acquire this book, I'd recommend going with the physical version, for the time being. Yeah, it's another large textbook to haul around. But it will be a lot easier to navigate and use."
The book was in great condition when it arrived,"The book was in great condition when it arrived. However, the cover was different from the image shown on the listing."
Good for beginners,"Good for beginners!
Is a great book. Has many themes, but, the author warns this. The book is a introduction to show you which theme and its way to solve problems is more interesting for you go deeply with other books and materials.
You will learn algoritmos and your difences. Some big facets too!"
Good price.,Came quickly. Good price.
Close enough to the U.S. Edition for most purposes,"Since this version of the book is for the Indian market, I was a bit worried about the potential differences from the U.S. 3rd edition. But after doing a first-hand comparison, I found a LOT more similarities than differences.
The biggest difference is the absence of the last two chapters. The U.S. edition includes: Chapter 26, ""Philosophical Foundations"", which covers arguments over consciousness in machines and the possibility of robot uprisings; and Chapter 27, ""AI: The Present and Future"", which *briefly* describes some things AI researchers need to work on before we can build a ""general-purpose intelligent agent"" (a.k.a. one single AI that will be good enough at a lot of different tasks). These two chapters are interesting, but I wouldn't call them core material, so I'm not surprised they got left out.
Other than that, the differences are astonishingly minor. The chapters are unnumbered, and some of them swapped places for no reason, but all the content from chapters 1 through 25 is here, plus the two appendixes. The ONLY edits to the text are removals of cross-chapter references. The U.S. version will say something like, ""When we discussed whatzits in Chapter 4, we mentioned that they come in two flavors, X and Y"", while the same line in this book will say, ""Whatzits come in two flavors, X and Y"". Again, those are the ONLY edits. All the other sentences are the same. The equations are the same. The diagrams are the same. The exercises at the end of each chapter are the same.
In short, if you can do without those last two chapters, buy this version and save your money."
A few too many Greek/Algebra symbols for the Layman,This version has a lot of math lingo in it. I prefer the older editions because they're written a little less formally.
"Good book, AI not my thing though so I ...","Good book, AI not my thing though so I sold it a few months later. If you have interest and want to learn AI, I feel like this book is as good as it gets."
Five Stars,A good book to have
A must read for anyone in CS,"A must have in any Computer Scientist's bookshelf.
Example code comes in multiple languages, well commented.
Each section gives enough detail without overloading the reader with to much."
Five Stars,Good book for the AI lovers.
Beware the ebook,The book itself is good but Amazon failed with the digital copy. Equations and images are so pixilated that it is impossible to make out some of the material.

Five Stars,Book in good conditions.
Insight and Architecture Recommendations for Nearly Every AI Application,"Thorough, authoritative overview of the state of the art in Artificial Intelligence. Deep information theory and automata insights throughout. And refreshingly example implementation test results to point out the practical limitation and scalability of many of the approaches."
High-level,"The book covers a wide range of topics, but not with sufficient detail. It is as if it is meant to tell you what can be done without telling you how to do it. Granted, some of the AI applications can only be alluded to in a textbook, but even the rudimentary applications are not explained with sufficient detail for a novice."
Writing style seems to flip frequently,The book is too verbose in some chapters and most of the examples are either too simple or are without  explanations. It seems that the chapters lack an overall tone to them. Perhaps this is due to the fact that there are two authors.
Not for US.  Indian subcontinent version,How different can it be?  Sure.  Not for US use.  Waste money somewhere else.  Book is good.  Some minor print error.  Probably that's why they are available here.  Seller is good.  Fast shipper.
Required textbook for AI class; highly recommended!,"This book was quite excellent, especially in presenting concepts to people who had no previous knowledge or experience with artificial intelligence. It provides an excellent overview of artificial intelligence concepts, though they gloss over the statistical parts of it (I guess they assumed you should already have knowledge of these).
The reason why this book got 4 instead of 5 stars was for two reasons: (1) the statistical knowledge that one needed to know in order to understand a concept was not adequately covered in the book; and (2) it is pretty much impossible to skip around the book (you're forced to learn chapter by chapter, otherwise you'll get lost in the later ones, so in terms of learning methods, it's not really flexible).
If you want to learn about artificial neural networks and reinforcement learning, the Mitchell text is pretty decent as well. Wikipedia also helps."
Great Customer Service,"When I first placed the order it said it was going to take something absurd like 30 days to ship it. I sent an email begging for it to come more quickly as I needed it for class (late order due to wait list rearranging). It came in a week! Which was great, but the book didn't have the same cover that was advertised. I think the content is the same / the cover is just a cover but slightly confusing. So far it seems ok but will re-evaluate after the semester."
The Bible,This book is the Bible of AI. Any respectable AI student / researcher should own a copy of this book.
"A great book, and great on Kindle","This is the first textbook I've bought through Kindle and I'm impressed with the system. In addition to that, the book is just great and I've already learned a bunch barely scratching the surface."
Great Textbook,"Very good textbook.
It is excellent for logical types that like to be led down the primrose path to knowledge.
Those that like their information scattered will have to use the index and several bookmarks."
Great text,Covers everything being done that can fall under the rubric of Artificial Intelligence. Some topics like machine learning are becoming fields of their own.
it was all what i wanted and it was well in time,it was well in time and it is also in good condition. I like it also the price was low as compared to the market price of the same book
Awesome!,"Amazon is usually pretty good about books. This one in particular I wound up getting brand new for the same price I was gonna buy a used one at my local bookstore. So, definitely check out amazon and compare prices"
a good introduction book,"it's good for ai beginners, u will get the basic and whole overview of ai
it is a little heavy to carry on"
Good,"It's a nice book. The pages have good quality, it's also very cheap for students.  I like it very much."
Had to get for school,"Just get the online version.  Much easier to find stuff, indexed, search better, copy and paste sample code.  Hard copy is useless"
A Feynmannesque intro to AI.,"Superb reference for any newbie with a mathematical will and the time to build basic AI. Endless applications for computational neuroscience models. This books thrives on cross-discipline learnings: psychology, neuroscience, economics, control theory, etc."
The IA reference book,AIMA is the state of the art literature on Artificial Intelligence. I recommend to all who want to have a basic knowledge provided to more detailed information on key topics in the area.
Okay,"This is a standard for AI courses so, quite possibly, if you're looking at this is because you have to buy it. Good exposition in some areas, but there are just not enough examples available for some of the mathematical techniques, and I really think students need to see a few examples before they can really be confident. Of course, a lot of this is space constraints, but better online support might help there, and if you're teaching, make sure to provide a few examples - doing the same problem over and over again to see if they 'get it' leads to lots of students who think they can solve problems they really can't."
its okay,It's an okay book for dipping your toe into AI theory. But a lot is going to depend on the professor who teaches the class.
A Modern Textbook,"I'm a CS major and have been interested in AI since early on in my university time, but my budget was small, so I bought some of the more inexpensive AI books out there. Most of them were disappointing--the language was stilted, the explanations were very formal and required long explanatory chapters on Turing machines to be understandable, and worst of all, they were outdated--some of them were written years before Deep Blue. I purchased this book for a university class on AI and loved it from the minute I opened it. It's very readable, includes both formal and informal explanations of most topics, and is about as up to date as a textbook like this can be. It feels as though it were written for modern readers like me, who prefer to get an intuitive grasp on something before diving in to the formal development. Like all textbooks, it's expensive, but worth it if you're interested in AI. I plan to keep it after my class is over."
Great Class Book,"I purchased this for my artificial intelligence class. This book is almost a staple among AI professors. The variety of methods and practical problems that are discussed and solved in this book is very impressive. The material can be challenging, especially if you are not mathematically or statistically oriented."
Four Stars,school for son
Worst Textbook of the year!,"I don't know why authors of AI and Machiner Learning books can not write their books explaining concepts in the most effective and efficient way, without using all the very abstract and meaningless jargon and expressions of the AI.
Why can't we find clear allegories in this book? why can't we find clear examples, flow-charts and other simple graphic illustrations on how to code an AI algorithm while suffering the minimum."
"Bought this for an online course, didn't reference it much","The first chapter (and overview of the field of AI) made for interesting reading, but I didn't do much except skim the rest of the book. I think for somebody looking to immediately apply machine learning techniques, this book probably wouldn't be the best choice. For a die-hard AI enthusiast or anyone taking a class not explicitly centered on machine learning, this would likely be a good fit."
Very helpful and thorough,This book is pretty much the standard of beginning and intermediate AI courses for a reason.  Its unparalleled depth and clarity make it an invaluable resource when doing anything AI-related!
The service was lightning fast and the book is just what I needed !!!,The service was lightning fast and the book is just what I needed !!!  Keep up the Grrrreat work .... Thanks Again Amazon
Keeper,"Anyone who likes to know everything about CS will want to keep this book around. I mean, I'm not reading it from start to finish, but its a great reference."
Average Read,I picked this ebook up for a class.  The ebook was ok in some parts.  Disadvantages: The ebook would discuss an example then reference a figure that was ten pages ago without providing a link so you have to go looking for the figure. I feel three stars is more than enough until they fix this problem with the ebook.
One of the few textbooks I actually read in college,"I recently graduated as a computer science major. Most of the textbooks I was required to get just sat unopened in the corner of my desk. This one however had was different. It was very interesting to read, fairly straightforward, and easy to follow. There were plenty of examples and illustrations that made some of the more difficult concepts more understandable. It definitively helped to stimulate my interest in the subject."
PRICE IS FAR TOO EXPENSIVE,"How is it that 2 weeks ago I only had to pay $56 for this book and now it is $96 ?
I don't deny the qualities of this book but nearly a hundred bucks for an ebook is a lot! It's not like the authors weren't wealthy enough to reduce the price..."
Terrible explanations,"This book is poorly written.  It doesn't explain anything in depth.  Instead, abstract terms are used in descriptions.  There were many parts where things were not clearly defined."
Artificial intelligence,Very good reference book on main trends in artificial intelligence. It's a bit outdated but all the basis are here with very clear explanations and implementation examples in pseudo code.
2 Device Limit,"Having bought this for the online AI class I didn't notice the device limit. In the day and age that people have several devices capable of reading Kindle books (I have 7 including work and home computers), there is no excuse for limiting it to two devices. I understand the concern with people sharing the books, but when will companies learn treating your consumers like criminals is a losing proposition."
Intro to AI online course text,"This was purchased as a companion text to the Stanford Into to AI online class taught by the authors. The text is a great complement to the class.  The class works through a lot of examples and clarifications on how to apply concepts.  The book provides the formal definitions, a lot more words and depth to the material covered in the classroom.
The book covers a lot of ground even for ~1000 pages.  The book does a great job of maintaining a uniform level of detail.  The class does a better job of ordering the material than the text.  Fortunately, the text is well written without accumulating a lot of jargon, such that you can skip around from one chapter and topic to the next in order to follow the classroom lectures without getting lost in jargon.
If you are taking the class, get the book.  If you are new to AI and trying to wade through this book, definitely sign up for the class."
Fantastic Book:  Horrendous Kindle Conversion,"This is the best introductory review to Artificial Intelligence on the market.  It's very well written and organized.  There are other books that are better for focusing on one particular aspect of AI, but as a general book this is the best I've seen.  If you are looking for a really good introductory textbook to AI that does not completely dumb things down, buy this book.
Most of the negative comments about this book come from people stating that it's not a big enough update from the prior edition.  While it's true that the entire field of AI has not been completely updated since the last edition, it's also not the case that this book comes out with new editions with the frequency of some Calculus or Economics textbooks where new editions seem to come out purely to ensure students can't buy a used book for the course.  The updates are substantial.  Whether the new edition gives you enough extra to want to buy it if you own the old edition is a decision only you can make for yourself after spending some time at the website for the book aima.cs.uberkeley.edu.
The Kindle conversion of this book is absolutely horrendous.  I prefer to buy electronic copies of books if possible so I don't have to carry a heavy hard copy around since I often read while commuting.  I would not recommend that for this book, even though at a 1000+ textbook sized pages, it is a pretty substantial book.  Fortunately a friend of mine had bought a Kindle copy of the book and I was able to see how bad it was and I bought the hard copy.
I recently got an email telling me Amazon was sending out an updated version of the Kindle version of Steve Job's biography because the conversion hadn't been done properly.  They really need to do that for this book.  Once done it may be a good idea to state on the website that the Kindle conversion has been fixed."
Its all right.,Not as good as I remember the first edition being.  It seemed like in the past there were more fundamental concepts and real techiniques to use while this one seems very theory centric.  Good book for covering all the bases however and not too bad a read.
"A Fine Supplementary Material, Some Minor Kindle Issues","This review is organized into two parts. The first part gives a general overview of the textbook and my thoughts about the content, while the second part gives a summary of the problems I've encountered while reading the Kindle version.
This book was made by multiple authors. Fortunately, the book's definitions and summaries are generally coherent. It has a through coverage on the history of AI, the definitions (those that are controversial have been noted as such), and provides psuedocode of many algorithms. Similar to other textbooks on this topic, it does not provide run-throughs of those algorithms.
The organizations of the book can be improved. I have some problems with the way they organized the material on the second part of the book (II: Problem Solving). Chapter 3 is named ""Solving Problems by Searching"", but I didn't realize all they did was on classical searches in Chapter 3 until I read Chapter 4. They could have explained why uniform-cost search is uninformed search even though it has a cost function better than they did in the textbook. A better naming scheme for those chapters would be ""Ch3: Global Search "", ""Ch4: Local Search/... (I would suggest breaking Chapter 4 and put it into different places.)"".
I bought the Kindle version, and it had many formatting problems. Most of them are minor (such as missing a ""space"" between two words, images appearing in different locations, image sizes too small, etc.) However, I had caught one specific error in the second part of the book (somewhere between chapter 3-5) where the fact is exactly the opposite than the one written (forgot to add the negation?) I should have marked and noted it so I can write down which error it was in the review but I was too lazy...
But it's a good purchase overall!"
Best IA book I've ever read,"I bought this when I've enrolled to the AI class. [...]
It was written by the two folks who are giving the classes."
"Formatting poor, 2 device limit","Formatting is as noted, poor enough as to obscure meaning.  I haven't seen the paper version, but the port is inadequate.  I'm also bothered that i can only use this on 2 devices.  I would love to be able to read it on my desktop at home, laptop in my office, and ipad when in between.  Frustrating.
3 chapters in, content is interesting, but given these drawbacks I'm likely to borrow another paper text from the library."
Kindle edition very poorly done,"I like this book, but the kindle edition is full of weird artifacts. This has rendered many in-line mathematical formulas largely unintelligible. For an example, every logical expression for ""x and y"", where the ""and"" should be a wedge, has instead been converted into a caret, which in every case is floating almost directly over the first variable. In another example, there is a reference to the ""one-element vector h0.6i."" It seems that the h and i were probably brackets originally, but it is impossible to tell.
In the real book there are words in the left margin that indicate where in the text a word has been first defined. In the kindle edition these are replaced with immense horizontal bands across the entire page with horizontal rules above and below, taking up three full rows of text, and they appear below the text that they refer to. Three of those in one paragraph, and you're lucky to even get the paragraph on the same screen with them, much less use them as a nice guide to where words are defined. All practical use they had in the real book is completely obliterated, and now they just take up a lot of room on the screen and make the book harder to read.
In the few places where they've kept the original formulas by means of images, the images look a little like they came from a malfunctioning copier. This is less of a problem than the other issues, but it is still annoying.
Overall a big thumb's down on the kindle edition!"
Warning: Extra Kindle DRM on this title,I loaded the Kindle version up on my iPad.  Great.  But I needed it on my laptop (Mac) for class.  I tried to load it with Kindle for Mac and it claims it has exceeded the maximum allowed licenses.  I am extremely pissed.  I bought the hard back for a small fortune and only slightly smaller fortune for e-access and I can't even read it on a measly two devices?  This is totally and completely unacceptable.
"Great book, terrible Kindle conversion","This is an excellent book however I cannot recommend purchasing the Kindle version of this text. It is atrocious. There are subject headings inserted after the subject is spoken about and, quite often, many heading stacked up on top of each other taking up almost an entire page with useless titles that are in the wrong order anyway. There are no page numbers, which is unacceptable for a text that is used by many college AI programs across the country. There are tons of hyphenation errors. The delineations between figure notes and the text are almost imperceptible so it is difficult to tell what text goes where. In general it is difficult to read and navigate due to this horrible Kindle conversion."
A Must Read for AI,"This is one of the most well written book I've ever read. It is well structured and have a large reference database, so if you want more you will be guided to a large historical reference for loads of papers.
It's quite advanced, and you need to study hard to understand it at all. The authors will guide you, but to understand the concepts presented you must do the exercises, and they are really hard. The exercises sometimes remember me ""The Art of Computer Programming"" by Knuth.
Well, I really recommend all people interested in AI to read this book."
Mandatory classic of the field,"I just recently took a course on AI using this as text book and just read about half of its chapters. Awesome introduction covering most of the AI topics, with very easy to understand description of the concepts.
While the book doesn't go in depth in any of the the major topics -- there are whole books dedicated to each (NLP, probabilistic models, machine learning, computer vision,  etc.) -- it's enough to grasp what those topics are about. At the end of each chapter it provides a very interesting and entertaining discussion of the current state of the art."
"Item is great, but Amazon mislead...","The book is awesome.  I'm using this for a class I'm taking right now and would recommend anyone interested in AI read this.
Additionally, the book is a great reference.  Topics are highlighted in the margins; which simplifies finding sought information.
My only complaint is with Amazon.  I ordered this book ""NEW"" but received a very obviously used item.  The book has slightly dented corners,
split seams in the inside cover, a cracked spine, and obvious curves in pages where the book lay open for extended periods, and was torn
in the upper corner of the front cover.  Given the condition, I would have returned the book immediately.  However, as said, I am taking a
class and have assignments due from this book and so can not send it back and can not be without it.  I wasn't sure how to contact Amazon
to correct this issue as this is my first time purchasing from them.  While I would recommend this book, I likely will not purchase from
Amazon in the future."
"Apparently, it's *the* AI book.","As textbooks go, this one is well-organized and illustrated, and in addition to educating you with regards to artificial intelligence, provides a decent background in introductory algorithms and probability.
What?  What's that?
He's on his way to city hall?
He's hacked all the security cameras?  Who gave him the capabilities to interface with such systems?!
...I'm terribly sorry.  I must attend to one of my more unruly projects.  Good day."
Good Book,"I am currently using this book for an Artificial Intelligence (AI) course at Duke University. I purchased the book because it was required for the course, and have been pleased with it thus far.
The book is well written and very comprehensive. It does not go into great detail with the various topics in AI, but it does give a very thorough overview of methods being used. It appears to be very up-to-date with the subject matter. Also, it is not programming language specific, which was great for me because my java and C are a bit rusty.
It is a bit pricey, but no more than other well written text books. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to get into or to teach a course in AI."
Exactly as expected,I bought this book and very promptly received it as expected.  I have no complaints and look forward to learning the material.
"Finally, a text book that you can read","Text books are usually cryptic and boring, but this one's actually quite fun to read. It's so easy and fun that I'm actually excited when the professor assigns a new reading. In fact, I liked it so much that I looked up the author to find more of his books, and guess what? The author works at Google. Someone in Google making a user-friendly textbook? I'm in!"
AI book,My seller was great. The textbook itself is ok but could be better on content.
Class Textbook O.K.,This book was purchased for a college graduate class (Advanced Artificial Intelligence). It is a good book. The sections I have read have been clear and understandable. In all this is one of the better textbooks I have used.
A must for anyone learning to program,"This is by far one of the best books i have ever read. For many years i have struggled with abtuse books on algorithms, programming languages and mathematics. This book is unlike anything i have read before. For the last 20 years, I as a lay person, who has not taken any university classes in AI and programming have had problems  moving passed certain levels of complexity in my understanding. Simple things like decision tress and recursion had eluded me in the many books i read, seeming intangible in the areas where they would interface to the real world. Reading the explanations in this book i have finally got it. These authors through scenarios, explanations and code (replicated in many languages on the companion website) explain decision based structures and there use in agent design ,assuming very little along the way, outside of an elementary understanding of programming and logic, thus not losing me the reader. They gave me the building blocks and showed me how and why i would want to assemble them.
The code in this book is both beautiful, elegant and succinct all at the same time. The hours of exploration and learning i got from these samples alone were worth the price of the book.
If you are learning to program -- Read this book.
If you interested in decision and value based reasoning -- Read this book.
This is not a short book, but it is well worth the time investment. I plan on having it done within the year. I have learned so much about what i realize i knew so little of before, but I am so much more capable now than i ever was before, and that is because of this book."
"Heavily used in class, but like most textbooks too expensive",Sadly the third eddition feels like part of the textbook racket where new editions are created with more of an aim at increasing profits than increasing quality.  Besides that gripe I found the book to be a better than average textbook.  I've used it much more heaviled that many other textbooks I've purchased.
A disappointment: minor update not worth the money,"- With AIMA 1st Edition, I had relearned AI anew from a fresh, insightful and wonderfully pedagogical perspective.
Best computer science textbook ever.
- With AIMA 2nd Edition, I got a lot of recent advances in AI brought to me in the same way, even if presented at times in a way that was too concise for a textbook, and read more like an encyclopedia.
Yet, great 2nd Edition.
- This 3rd Edition is alas AIMA 2.1 and not the AIMA 3.0 that I was waiting for. The new material and new insightful way to organize past material are both scant. Certainly not worth the price for those who own the 2nd Edition.
Don't get me wrong, if you are about to buy your first AI textbook, this is a great buy as it is still light years ahead of the competition. But some chapters that were getting really thin and outdated in 2009 did not get significant updating.
This is particularly true for knowledge representation. Missing are all the recent yet already consolidated advances brought about by the new solutions to the frame problem (such as the fluent calculus), default reasoning, abduction-based and case-based diagnosis, rule-based reasoning (such as constraint handling rules, answer sets, object-oriented logic programming etc.), in short, all forms of reasoning that are neither pure deduction, nor probabilistic. Advances on multi-agent reasoning are also not covered. I understand that to summarize AI in 1000 pages many important topics will not make the cut, but I feel, as a researcher on the topic for the past 25 years and lecturer on it for the past 15 years, that this 3rd edition contains obsolete stuff from the 80s (like frames, semantic networks, production systems, situation calculus, etc.) instead of their modern substitute listed above.
In short, after two Herculean efforts, it seems like the authors put far less work in this one. As a result, we are left without an truly comprehensive and up-to-date text to teach AI and agents. I hope the incoming text by David Poole will cover some of the weaknesses of this AIMA 2.1."
Not big changes but still good,"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern approach is a very good book which explores concepts in the area of AI. It covers most of the techniques in the area (there are some important AI techniques missing such as KDD and Data Mining), however it doesn't go deep in any concept so if you're looking for a specialized reference this is not the one.
The third edition of this book offers a few changes:
- a very updated list of references
- some (not many) new exercises
- they rewrote concepts in order to be up-to-date with the state of the art
- they changed the order of some chapters
All in all, it is still a very good introductory book, it is well-written and very easy to understand. If you are new in the field this is the first textbook to read."
Great overview of the field,"Just got the book, so I haven't read it fully, but a first pass review already convinced that this will be a key reference in the blossoming field of machine learning. It is amazing to see the progress in the field over the past decades, as evidenced by the changes of the versions of the book, and humbling to think of how much we still have to understand and learn in this field."
The optimal learning algorithm for learning A.I.,"Progress in the field of artificial intelligence has executed a random walk after establishing itself with a bang in the 1950s. Optimistic predictions of the future of A.I. in that decade only partially came true in the decades after that. Currently, the field is divided up into subfields going by the names data mining, computational intelligence, intelligent agent theory, expert systems, etc. This book is the best book available for learning about this fascinating and important subject. The applications of A.I. are enormous, and will increase dramatically in the decades ahead. Indeed the prospects are very exciting, and the authors themselves have been involved heavily in extending the frontiers of the subject. Some of the main points of the book that really stand out include:
1. The useful exercises at the end of each chapter. 2. The discussion of simple reflex and goal-based agents. 3. The treatment of constraint satisfaction problems and heuristics for these kinds of problems. 4. The overview of iterative improvement algorithms, particularly the discussion of simulated annealing. 5. The discussion of propositional logic and its limitations as an effective A.I. paradigm. 6. The treatment of first-order logic and its use in modeling simple reflex agents, change, and its use in situation calculus. There is a good overview of inference in first-order logic in chapter 9 of the book, including completeness and resolution. 7. The treatment of logic programming systems; the Prolog language is discussed as a logical programming language. Noting that Prolog cannot specify constraints on values, the authors discuss constraint logic programming (CLP) as an alternative logic programming language that allows constraints. 8. The discussion of semantic networks and description logics. 9. The treatment of conditional programming via the conditional partial-order planner (CPOP). 10. Representing knowledge in an uncertain domain and the semantics and inference in belief networks. 11. The brief discussions on stochastic simulation methods and fuzzy logic. 12. The discussion on computational learning theory 13. The treatment of neural networks, especially the discussion of multilayer feed-forward networks and the comparison between belief networks and neural networks. 14. The brief discussion on genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming. 15. The discussion on explanation-based learning and the technique of memoization. 16. The (excellent) overview of inductive logic programming. This relatively recent area was new to me at the time of reading so I appreciated the discussion. The authors briefly mention the approach of discovery systems and the Automated Mathematician (AM). 17. The interesting discussion of telepathic communication between robots via the exchange of internal representations. 18. The discussion on a formal grammar for a subset of English and the extensive treatment of natural language processing. 19. The discussion of speech recognition and the use of hidden Markov models and the Viterbi algorithm. 20. The fascinating discussion on robotics, particularly the treatment of configuration spaces, which brings in some techniques from computational geometry and topology. 21. The discussion on the philosophical ramifications of A.I. Future developments in A.I. will provide a unique testing ground for philosophy, in a way that will be unparalleled in the history of philosophy. Philosophers critical of A.I. will have the opportunity to check whether their arguments against the possibility of &quot;strong A.I.&quot;, are in fact true."
Very well written very consise introductory book on AI,"This book is very well written makes the complex subject a little easier to comprehend.  The best thing about this book however is probably the integration of historical accomplishments inside the text.  You don't just get an explanation on why something is and thats it, you get to see how an idea originated and evolved over time.  I wish more computer science books integrated the history of the genre like this book does."
