Great book covering all the basics of Comp Science,Excellent
Not python syntax,"The codes written in this book do not follow optimum python syntax. The coding complexity is more than what's needed.
Although good for concept"
Five Stars,If you want to have detail knowledge about analysis this is right book for you
Advanced python covered in this,"Really worth it &#60;3 Loved the concepts in the book.Also, the delivery was on time.Thank you, amazon for making this book available!"
Nice but no Great,"DS & Algo in python is very different in python as compared to the legacy languages like C, C++, JAVA
The code snippets are not that simple to grasp as there are other codes with same complexity but easier codes.
On a personal level i'd recommend this book to everyone but one have to made effort to get through it."
Four Stars,Really good book. All the concepts are detailed and with the examples.
This is the best book you can have for preparing for Tech interviews,This is the best book you can have for preparing for Tech interviews. Gives a systematic way to approach problems. Start with a Brute force approach and keeps optimising and using different techniques for better solutions. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
Not for the novice Python programmer (not a compliment),"First of all, this book is purely passable if you are looking at learning some good programming practices for your standard algorithms. The author writes some really horrible python code, which is not Pythonic by any stretch of imagination. It seems more like Java code than Python.
Other most irritating bit apart from the non Pythonic code is the lack of output for the problems.
So, this book is quite OK if you are already a decent Python programmer and are looking for one place to find most of the algorithms. Though it will be a disaster if you learn to program from this book."
Damaged book received,Good book for learning python but received a damaged book
Five Stars,Amazing book for understanding and exploring Data Structures and Algorithms through Python. Do buy this book! Cheers :)
Good book but no index,Good book but no index
Great book on data structures,Great book on data structures
I am rating it 2 because of the following points.,"1) Description for each question is just copied and pasted from Data Structure and algorithm made easy in C, so sometimes it doesn't match python syntax.
2) Some of the class definitions of data structures are missing.
3) Structuring of the code segment could have been better."
"The Book is good, but i have a phobia of Snakes","The Book is good, but i have a phobia of Snakes, I hope that writer or the publishing company would have given thought something more subtle while making the design of cover.
Other than everything is good."
Five Stars,Excellent //
Four Stars,Delivered on time and this is one of the best book.
Four Stars,Awesome book
"i like the way the author, describe all the concept but this book is not for the beginner .if you know a little bit about progra","i like the way the author, describe all the concept but this book is not for the beginner .if you know a little bit about programming then buy this book.overall it's cover all the topics in detail ."
Not worth the money or time. It is kind ...,Not worth the money or time. It is kind of frustrating to read the book especially if you already have taken a course in data structures.
Highly recommended for Python programmers,"Though Python has been a created for more than two decades, It is hard to get a good reference on traditional data structures like Tree, Graph. This book is an excellent book for Python programmers and other programming language lovers too.
This book thoroughly explained various algorithms with practice exercises and solutions along with Python language examples.
and do not get scared over the snake on the cover pic. It's just a painted hand.
It will make you a better Python programmer and you can give a stand over those C++/Java programmers on competitive programming."
Good book.,It's a good reference book for learning python.
Good read,Good read
Good and god speed delivery,Good and god speed delivery
Awesome,Good Book to learn datastructure
As am working with IoT i Strongly Recommend this Book for Reference and for beginners also,"It's Superb Book to refer as algorithmic Approach.As am working with IoT i Strongly Recommend this Book for Reference and for beginners also.
This Book will Lead you in your Python Learning."
Not for beginners,"I got this book assuming it will help learning Python.
But, the content seems to be different. Can you refund?
Please reply."
Good explanation on python algorithms.,Good explanation on python algorithms.
Five Stars,One of the best book to learn about data structure and algorithms in python from scratch.
It would be great if they include python introduction at the beginning of the book.,"It would be great if they include python introduction at the beginning of the book.
At least, mention that in preface."
Easy to read and practical book,Written by Indian for Indians. Easy to read and practical book. Paper quality and outer cover could be still be improved. I thank the author for writing an excellent book .
Good,Good
Not a book for python learners.,"Not a book for python learners... It deals with time/space computation, and they've used python as a language to teach that topic. Quality of the book is very good though."
Well I have a course in NIT where we are ...,Well I have a course in NIT where we are supposed to implement algorithms in python. Anf this is the same book DS and ALGO for GATE  by karumanchi sir only that the codes are replaced from c to python. Some python implementation need some amount of modification .
Not worth it,"I bought this book after lots of positive review but there are lots of typos in many answers. It's like is a first draft and author gives you for proof reading.
Please don't consider this book for theory purpose. It just provide you many practice questions at one place. It only solves purpose if you need to practice question before interview."
Five Stars,Good book for understanding data structures with Python.
Three Stars,Its good book but Flipkart gives with less price around 539rs.
Best book.??,It's a very good book. This book is suitable for all levels of python learners. I would highly recommend this book to all the avid learners out there. Go grab your own copy.
Five Stars,The book is very well written and can be used to crack coding interviews
Four Stars,"examples are nice, but the packing is poor"
Five Stars,Very well written and good for jogging your memory :)

Awesome,Awesome
good,good
Thanks for Amazon for good deliver and Thanks for Narasimha,"This books is really help me to learn Data Structure by Pythonic way, Thanks for Amazon for good deliver and Thanks for Narasimha....."
This is not the book for beginners in python. ...,This is not the book for beginners in python.....if u want to solve problems via programming u can use this book
Go for it!!!,"awesome book!! every problem is explained in perfect manner. Buy it if you want to clear your concepts of data structure in python. Well structured topics and most importantly the quality of problems, every problem in this book is related with depth of the respective problem. Solutions are also perfectly explained. Thanks @Narsimha sir."
recommend this to all sort of python programmers,This is a quite amazing book.It's not only meant for beginners but also can be read by advanced programmer.This one will help you to reach to the peak of python programming with data structures. Good book. I recommend this to all sort of python programmers.
This book is for someone starting to learn python with algorithms,"This book is for someone starting to learn python with algorithms, This is not a reference book for python. If you are looking for reference book for python buy any other book."
Not my taste,"It's too complex. I have read other book on data structures and algorithms specially meant for python which was much better. It was an e-book. I forgot it's name.
I brought it since it's written by an Indian author who have a reputation for being just to the point and simple without overloading stuffs. In that case it's very lacking.
Also there are no practical examples/ exercises to learn concepts just Algorithmic complexity. Looks like author is trying to make you rote learn these.
You can go for https://interactivepython.org/ it was much better content and have good examples."
Buy it without a second thought!,"One of the best books to clear DS concepts. Concepts are very nicely explained with detailed examples. Moreover, it will also help you in interviews."
Five Stars,The book is great!
not at all good for beginners who are unfamiliar with Python,"not at all good for beginners who are unfamiliar with Python , even if they are aware of other languages .. different type of book , different from conventional programming , is good only for those who are well versed with basics in every type of data structures , syntaxes etc"
Good one,"If you want to gain a deeper understanding of Algorithms with Python and how it relates to basic ideas in computer science, I recommend this book enough. The author has an uncanny ability to provide deep yet simple explanations, and to make them crystal clear with pedagogically brilliant examples."
Four Stars,"nice explanation, must read book for data structure."
Five Stars,Amazing book.
Very good book for all the pythonistas out there!,"Very good book ...may be you can try a basic python before you go for this book, but definitely worth it!"
Very useful for data analysis,The book is very good for beginners and for people who would want to data analysis in python where speed of your algorithm is key.
Four Stars,This is good one to learn about data structures in java.
