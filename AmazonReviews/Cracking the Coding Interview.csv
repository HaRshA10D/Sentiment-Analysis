Four Stars,"Paper quality is poor.But , content quality is out of the world"
Five Stars,Must have book :)
Three Stars,"Sorta helpful for those who require guidance, rather than self exploring."
But a good resource for interview preparation,Slightly advanced for ppl new to Data Structures and Algos. But a good resource for interview preparation.
"Top of the line contents, But...!!!","Content wise this book provides top notch details to excel in any interview for any Tech Career level, 5/5 for the content this book offers.
That said, the main concern here is the quality of the book itself. The pages are slightly Yellow in color, it's similar to the buff sheets we used during our maths class for practice problems. The text printed in the back side is clearly visible on the front page. That's annoying & quite difficult to read on. It seems like the quality is being compromised to sell it at 30 - 50 INR less than other sites who sell the same book. 0/5 for the book quality.
Hope Amazon is listening to these concerns..."
Poor quality,"Book paper and binding quality is very poor..
I purchased this book not satisfied with quality. And all problem and solution also provided online."
Amazing book. All the aspects of a coding interview ...,Amazing book.All the aspects of a coding interview are stated clearly.Most of the critical concepts are explained through simple examples.The interview preparation strategies are extremely useful and applicable in real-world.
One Star,Printing is very bad. Very small font.
it sucks. you know what could be the best option,"Book's content is as expected extraordinary. BUT paper quality man !! it sucks. you know what could be the best option? instead of buying a new one, if your friends have this book already just take a xerox of it. It will probably cost even less than this actual book price. Idiots they are selling waste and recycled papers for this much amount. Utterly disappointed."
Best preparatory book for all Coding Interviews.,"I purchase this book for 570 odd rupees and it is worth the buy.
Of course the paper quality of Indian edition is not too good. But the Indian edition of this book is almost (1/4)th the price of the International edition (around 28$).The missing pages in the Indian edtion of the book is present in the link as mentioned in the description .
It provides some valuable tips .It also covers topics regarding about the problems with the Resume ,Preparation plan one faces.
It is a good choice only if the reader knows Java. To all the 189 programming questions in the book,the solutions are coded in Java. So one who doesn't know Java would definitely find it bit hard to cope up with the book.
Note:****The solutions in C++ language are provided in Github repository of  CareerCup.****"
Five Stars,The book is good
Otherwise a great book.,Few pages were removed from the indian version to reduce the price. Otherwise a great book.
Best book on programming interview,"This book is the best book on how to crack programming interviews and it covers  over 189 programming interview questions, ranging from the basics to the trickiest algorithm problems, problem solving techniques, techniques to ace the behavioral interview questions  and solutions to the problems. This book is easy to understand and is of great help in enabling you to perform at your very best."
THE CODING EXAMPLE ARE GOOD IN THIS BOOK.HIGHER LEVEL THINKING,ITS GOOD BOOK
Five Stars,Such a wonderful book for learn Programming and for interviews.
Paper quality is poor,"As I saw in some comment, the paper is dull in colour, that was expected. But there were granular paper dust which was from the edges of paper (like the paper was cut and the dust wasn't cleared). I had to clean the book before using it.
Amazon: I didn't get a bookmark along with this book. I had to use Flipkart's bookmark. Too bad."
Awesome book,"For long time I have been searching for a book on ds and Algo with an approach towards preparing for the tier 1 companies. Day 1 I have this book in hand, and I am so happy I ordered it. Every software developer fresher or experienced should have this. Must buy. Also, amazon fulfilment best as ever."

The quality of pages is good and the content is best as promised,Product was delivered withing 4 days of purchase. The quality of pages is good and the content is best as promised. Would recommend the geeks to buy it. :P
Best book for learning about coding interviews.,"Let me get straight to the main points and clear all your doubts :
Paper Quality : The book is printed on semi-rough pages usually used in typical novels. But still the pages a not that thin, they are thicker than you would expect.
Paper Binding quality : Same as that of a typical novel, i.e. very nice.
Missing Pages : I'm quoting what the author says - &#34;In an effort to reduce your costs as much as possible, we have removed the following content from the Indian edition...Which can be downloaded online at crackingthecodinginterview.com/indian_edition.html&#34;.
If you want high quality pages and no missing pages then feel free to spend over ?2000 (I'm saying this on assumption, please verify it first)."
Good!,"I was afraid about the quality after reading all the comments down here. But the book looks pretty good and interesting, it's been a day now!"

Awesome :),Great Book indeed.
Four Stars,Very good book.
Just fine quality pages,"Just got this book delivered from Amazon. Haven't gone through the content but after reading through the reviews, I was very concerned about the book quality. Happy to find that it's just fine plus for a book to be this size, it's very light."
Don't buy the Indian Edition,"Can't be more cheap for an Indian edition. I mean literally cheap!
To begin with, the Indian edition is printed on extremely poor quality paper. Though this makes the book lighter but I am not certain for how long will it last. Looks like it might wear out in few weeks.The print quality is absolutely not worth it.
So maybe you'd expect that you should at least get the copyrighted content to leverage the cost. Sorry to disappoint you, but I found that some sections have been omitted to reduce the cost. This is not a fair practice author.
If you want the content in its entirety, you know where to go pirates."
Five Stars,worth to buy

Nice book for interview preparation. It provides you the good orientation for attempting interview. But the best part I liked about the book is that it includes design questions which are hard to find at one place either in the books or internet."

Five Stars,Good one
One of the best books ever for interview preparations,"I have used the 4th edition in the past and have considered it to be an awesome resource. 6th edition is very different and has lots of new topics and content. About the book, some of the pages are not bound in the correct order like page 144 arrives after page128 and to find page 129 you need to go to where page 144 should have been. This is at multiple locations in the book.
Otherwise a great resource."
A must-have book for any coding interview!,"Easily one of the best books of its kind as the questions given here, if tried on our own with the help of the hints and solutions if needed, are sure to make us better codes and more importantly, better problem analysts!"

Four Stars,Good book with nice expansions on the topics.

Must read for those looking for career in CS domain,"This book is undoubtedly the best book in the market to prepare for the coding interviews. In this edition in particular, the author has mentioned in detail, as how to tackle a coding problem. If the book is religiously read and followed, I believe he/she can crack any major interview."
Very Costly,"Why this book is so costly, Previous editions are quite cheap as compared to it. Any chances of lowering the price."
Non-CS candidates transitioning to coding career will also find this book immensely helpful.,"Extremely helpful book. Even a non-CS degree candidate looking to transition into coding career, will find this book immensely helpful. I recommend buying this book and go through chapters carefully and do take your time. The author is also active on Quora in case you need to ask her questions."
