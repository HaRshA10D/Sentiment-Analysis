HP 15--be016 TU one day experiance,"Specifications:-same as given.
Design:-decent look.
Warranty:---1 yr, you can check in HP by Ur serial no.
Battery: 4--5 hrs.
The only problem which I found is that the OS is DOS and when you will install windows 10 pirated copy it won't work smoothly, apart from that all looks good till now..
I shared this experience by only one day use of laptop..
I hope it will work fine...
*Seller should provide laptop bag.."
Five Stars,Lowest cost
Battery fitting is loose,"I ordered the product during the great amazon sale period and received it within 4-5 days.
Product is good and everything seems fine except the battery. The laptop battery is bit loose and make sound when we hold the laptop on the back. This is not expected from a brand new laptop."

Good laptop,"Good product no issues,installed Windows 10 64bit.1year manufacturer warranty is available.no driver cd is available with this laptop,you have to download it from hp site, light weight easy to handle, satisfied with the video and audio clarity. Purchased the product for RS.23990/-"
Nice product which i received in starting i'm facing driver ...,"Nice product which i received in starting i'm facing driver problems means not getting any drivers but in final when i update windows than all is well. Laptop is running well battery backup is good. looking wise good, slim product. but only one bad thing that i have received laptop and charger only nothing more like driver CD nor any kits."
Ok product,Nice product in such a low peice...........support only window 7and 10 .I prefer to install window 10 .sound are low .If u are want to use this laptop for video editing than go for i5 processor ...
Im happy with the purchase.,"I purchased this during the great indian sale for 23990+15% cash back,  it has everything  i hoped it would,  I'm not a heavy user,  i dont play much games, what i need though was the storage,  which gives me plenty,  i read through the reviews  before i purchase this and thanks to the detailed reviewers,  I'm not a tech savvy so i was bit worried  about the freeDos but in the end it works out alright. Some of the comments says  they were disappointed post purchasing that windows is missing.  Well,  it does say FREEDOS it should not be the reason they give 1 star. If there are technical  words you dont understand by all means look it up in Google before making your purchase. And just use Windows 10 64bit, and it works just fine.  There is no problem whatsoever. My cats loves it and i love it,  thats all there is to it.  ??"
Window 7 drivers are not supported and mouse pad is ...,Window 7  drivers are not supported and mouse pad is not compartable
More than satisfied.,"Works as advertised, great value for money (the best in its price bracket). Installed (elementary) OS with no  problem whatsoever. Although keys on the keyboard feel slightly plasticy. Anti-glare display would have made it perfect (display is not of premium quality).
Everything else is excellent."
Four Stars,Nice one

worth buying  by Tarun Jangir,"Purchase at 23990Rs in great india sale. similar configuration HP-15be012tu product sale at flipkart at Just 22990Rs 14-18 May 2017 sale. perhaps i buy this from amazone.  install all three windows 7,8.1, and 10.  in window 7 (32 bit) could not able to get all drivers. in windows 8.1 all the things are good but surprisingly could not find the wifi turn on option then finally installed windows 10 and get all drivers from hp officially site. really good and worth buying. strongly recommended to everyone best product in this price range.."

Physical overview&#62; very slim in this range. I like the texture on laptop and even on touch pad area.see attached photos. I have purchased turbo silver color. Which look awsome. 3 Usb 1 hdmi 1 Lan port  1 3.5 mm audio jack and dvd writter. 10/10 for look
Hardware-
1) it has i3 6th gen. hold down guys 6th gen is completely different than old generation. Just google it for skylake architecture.
2) 1 tb toshiba hard drive. Got issue when try to install windows 10 which resolved by following few steps.youtube link- https://youtu.be/VZqhz2p1OFQ
3) sound quality is awsome but i had some issue. When i installed windows 10 speaker sound was very low and tried all options by following youtube videos but nothing worked finall called the Hp customer support and spent some 15 min time on call and they guided me step by step. Kudos to HP team. Just note down how i resolved my issue- just download and install realtek driver from Hp support india website by following some steps. Thats all. After that sound volume and quality both are awsome.
4) Battery is plus point again. On first day i got more than 5hrs battery
5) No fan noise. Piece of pease. Very sulent operations.
6) Not sure of other brand laptop but this one has 27gb SSD drive. But not sure I can use or not. I guess DOS and other drivers of hp are installed on that.
7) Guys this major plus point. This laptop comes with single 4gb chip. They have taken care of  additional ram. I observed other brand give 2gb*2=4gb means your 2 slots of mother boards are occupied by rams. Now problem is if you want increase the RAM then you need purchase 2 4gb ram to make 8gb or remove one slot of 2gb and add 4gb to make 6gb but this not recommended. So kudos to HP to take care of thease.
8) screen clarity is good (nothing special than other brand)
Final verdict- i3 6gen and AMD A10 9600p (just search Acer AMD A10 9600P laptop) here AMD is very powerful almost equal performance of i5 processor and price of i3 is almost same as AMD A10 9600p laptops (just google benchmark score of AMD A10 9600P) but finally i chosen this because long life of Intel processor.
Sorry for long review"
Do not buy freedos!!,Windows is not pre-installed on this laptop. If you are not some tech pro pls don't buy this laptop..figuring out how to install will be extremely frustrating. There are no instructions that come along so you have to figure out as u go. Now HP centre representative is telling me I need to spend 10-12K to buy original windows OS. Regret purchasing this.
