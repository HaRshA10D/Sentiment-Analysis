Must buy for anyone wanting to take a deep dive into Machine Learning,"A really good book that introduces ML algorithms. Many common ML algorithms are introduced and implemented. The book may appear a bit complex for someone who just started machine learning. Mix the contents of this book with some good courses online, and you are good to go.
The book is not for the impatient or faint hearts. The book shows actual implementation of various ML algorithms in Python using NumPy library."
Five Stars,Good
Duplicate. Poor print. Missing Pages in between,This review is NOT regarding the book contents. Please be aware that this is a duplicate copy and looks more like a xerox of the original. I understand that this is a trade-off for the price but the print quality is very poor. Diagrams cannot be clearly read and there are lots of missing pages. There is not point in buying such a book in low price if the print quality is unreadable in most of the places.
"Awesome book, Page quality is awesome","Awesome book ,Page quality is awesome . Good explanation ,even a layman can understand the difficult concepts of Machine Learning ."
