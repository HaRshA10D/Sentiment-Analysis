Super helpful and awesome book must buy,A really very awsm book..most recommended if wanna gt insight into machine learning..
Simply The Best,"This book explains Machine learning and AI in layman's terms. Very fascinating and interesting to read.
Best suited for clearing your engineering course in AI with ease.
5 Stars and recommended."
"Standard book for ML and the bookshelf, next to ...","Standard book for ML and the bookshelf, next to Gilbert Strand and the likes. Print quality is for indian subcontinent. Worth buying the international quality."
Five Stars,Good Product. As described. Delivered on time.
Five Stars,Good book for basic to moderately advanced understanding.
Paper quality is too poor.,The paper quality is too poor and hence I had to return the book.
Amazing book,"Good Book for beginners..
Very simple language and easy to understand the maths."
Not really good for beginners,I am sorry but it's not really good for beginners. Lot of complexity and mathematical equations will not give real good understanding.
Four Stars,Nice book
Nice good book,Good content explained in very simple language.
Five Stars,contains simple and lucid explanation for machine learning algorithms
Not for begineers,Not for starters
Five Stars,Best book for machine learning.
Best book to get started with machine learning,"Best book to get started with machine learning. Easy to understand and though it's pretty old, it contains well explained concepts which are relevant even today."
it's better to jump in through Andrew Ng's course on Coursera,"For someone who wants to use machine learning in their projects, this is not a practical book. it's better to jump in through Andrew Ng's course on Coursera. This book is very theoretical and would be better for a student of machine learning."
Five Stars,"Good book no damage, every thing is fine in case of the delivery as well...."
Excellent book,Awesome book for machine learners. I love it.
Five Stars,Excellent
Four Stars,Really good reference book for those getting into machine learning.
Hallmark of excellance,"This is quite classical book, but the concepts are the much needed basics to understand the advanced machine learning. It's impeccable accuracy(although i am not expert enough to weigh the book) has helped me in getting hold of basics of Machine learning. It is much needed book for people working in Speech processing, Text processing, Image Processing etc apart from those working on pure AI related fields, as they have to use ML Techniques in their areas to advance their fields.
Remember this guy, Tom Mitchell is considered as faculty of CMU, and is considered as one of the pioneer in the ML field. Regardless of other ML books by Peter Flach, Kevin Murphy, Abu Mostafa, Trevor Hastie , C.Bishop, Theodoridis, ethem alpaydin, Mitchell books stands out in several aspects like simplicity, accuracy, and quality."
Superb book,Amazing book for beginners of machine learning.. Classic!!!
Four Stars,Good book but few topics not covered properly.
Best book to refer for Machine Learning,"As i had Machine Learning course in my Post Graduation, and this book was our text book. And as far as my journey through the topics covered in this book has been mesmerising. Tom Mitchell is one of the renowned person in this field, so all my dear friends dont miss this book to have it when you are sailing through this course..:)"
Four Stars,"Good delivery, quality products"
Amazing explanation of concepts by Tom Mitchell,Amazing explanation of concepts by Tom Mitchell. I like the flow of concepts through the book and also the mathematical proofs provided for many of the concepts.
Five Stars,Great comprehensive book for machine learning
Five Stars,Good packed and suitable price
Excellent Book,An excellent book for fundamentals of machine learning
No issues faced.,"Book was delivered as promised . Good condition , nice packaging. Now as far as the contents of the book go , I've understood that the book serves as a basic guide to understanding machine learning . If you need an advanced understanding , then I probably would not recommend this one."
Five Stars,Really good book for learning the fundamentals of machine learning
"Must Read for "" Machine Learning "" Learners.",Excellent reference for understanding Machine Learning. Tom Mitchell from CMU explains concepts very well.
Great Service. Good Product,Great Service. Good Product
Good introduction to ML,"Provides a good introduction and  overview of Machine Learning techniques. Covers a lot of topics, but only a few are covered in depth."
But some diagrams are very dull,"Everything is ok, But some diagrams are very dull"
The classic,"I am new to Machine Learning and this is my first book(read 4 chapters of Ethem Alpaydin; found that good as well). Have some exposure to Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks but otherwise not much.
I find this book very easy and have covered till 6th chapter now(in 3 weeks). I can confidently say, I follow almost 85% of the content that I have read so far. But without a good grounding in set notations, probability, logic etc one could find it not that easy to turn pages.
Obviously doesnt cover latest developments as the original text was published in 1997. Nevertheless looks and feels very relevant since it provides a framework to think about and analyze machine learning algorithms."
