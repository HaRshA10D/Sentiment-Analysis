I haven't read the first two editions so i cannot judge if there is a lot of new stuff in this 3th edition, but i feel like i am able to make an expert system myself, having read the book.  Not for the layman though.  You need to have an engineer's or mathematical mind to grasp everything.  The book really covers everything from the neat's point of view.  In the heart, i am a scruffy but what this book has taught me, can certainly do no harm as it is a real overview of all the scientific techniques involved in making expert systems and other applications in AI.\n",

      "Title : Good book, but the Kindle version still needs some work.\n",
      "Content : As a textbook, it's fine. It covers a wide range of concepts and topics in the field of artificial intelligence and is a good resource to have around.\n",
      "My rating is mainly based on the state of the Kindle version. There are some issues I have with it that keep me from enjoying it further.\n",
      "The biggest problem is the overall format. Pages aren't just digital versions of the physical pages in the real book. They're broken up into thousands of screenshot-like segments. You can't scroll &#34;up to the top of a page&#34; or &#34;down to the bottom&#34; because each page segment is only as big as your screen. This would be fine if it were a much smaller book. My tablet counts 33,261 page segments when I use it, so you can see how this might be cumbersome for such a large book.\n",
      "The effect of the above problem could be reduced a bit if the table of contents were complete. As it is, the table of contents is very limited in what section it allows you to &#34;jump&#34; to. The book is broken up into sections, each of which is covered in a number of chapters, as one might expect. But unfortunately, the Kindle version only lets you jump to the first chapter of each section, not any chapter in the book. This means that you either have to swipe through hundreds of page segments to get to the spot you want, or you can use the slider at the bottom of the screen and hope you land near where you want to be (the slider won't give you any additional info about where you are, either). I suppose you could swipe through it ahead of time and place book marks at each chapter header, but that shouldn't be something a reader has to do to navigate a book by its own chapters.\n",
      "The only other things I can think to mention have to do with resizing the screen. It's not very smooth at all. In fact, there is usually a noticeable delay when you try to resize a page segment, probably because it has to re-calculate all the page segments to fit the new zoom scale. I'm sure this could be improved if each page were just a digital version of its physical counterpart. The other problem is that the images in the book do not resize with the text. This is an especially troublesome problem for this particular book, since there are a number of intricate diagrams and images of pseudo code algorithms that are very difficult to read at this size. I can't even read some of them, and my tablet screen is larger than 10 inches.\n",
      "This is actually the second Kindle book I've purchased. The first one (Introduction to the Theory of Computation, by Michael Sipser) was near flawless. Each page was a digital representation of its physical counterpart, the table of contents was complete, and resizing was very smooth. I bought this AI book in Kindle form hoping for a similar experience, but I guess not all the kinks have been worked out yet. It honestly comes off feeling like a beta version that isn't quite finished. But given my experience with that other Kindle book, I know improvements can be made to this one.\n",
      "All that being said, I can still use the Kindle version of this book. It's just very inconvenient. If you're looking to acquire this book, I'd recommend going with the physical version, for the time being. Yeah, it's another large textbook to haul around. But it will be a lot easier to navigate and use.\n",

      "Content : Since this version of the book is for the Indian market, I was a bit worried about the potential differences from the U.S. 3rd edition. But after doing a first-hand comparison, I found a LOT more similarities than differences.\n",
      "The biggest difference is the absence of the last two chapters. The U.S. edition includes: Chapter 26, \"Philosophical Foundations\", which covers arguments over consciousness in machines and the possibility of robot uprisings; and Chapter 27, \"AI: The Present and Future\", which *briefly* describes some things AI researchers need to work on before we can build a \"general-purpose intelligent agent\" (a.k.a. one single AI that will be good enough at a lot of different tasks). These two chapters are interesting, but I wouldn't call them core material, so I'm not surprised they got left out.\n",
      "Other than that, the differences are astonishingly minor. The chapters are unnumbered, and some of them swapped places for no reason, but all the content from chapters 1 through 25 is here, plus the two appendixes. The ONLY edits to the text are removals of cross-chapter references. The U.S. version will say something like, \"When we discussed whatzits in Chapter 4, we mentioned that they come in two flavors, X and Y\", while the same line in this book will say, \"Whatzits come in two flavors, X and Y\". Again, those are the ONLY edits. All the other sentences are the same. The equations are the same. The diagrams are the same. The exercises at the end of each chapter are the same.\n",
      "In short, if you can do without those last two chapters, buy this version and save your money.\n",

      "Content : This is a standard for AI courses so, quite possibly, if you're looking at this is because you have to buy it. Good exposition in some areas, but there are just not enough examples available for some of the mathematical techniques, and I really think students need to see a few examples before they can really be confident. Of course, a lot of this is space constraints, but better online support might help there, and if you're teaching, make sure to provide a few examples - doing the same problem over and over again to see if they 'get it' leads to lots of students who think they can solve problems they really can't.\n",

      "Title : A Modern Textbook\n",
      "Content : I'm a CS major and have been interested in AI since early on in my university time, but my budget was small, so I bought some of the more inexpensive AI books out there. Most of them were disappointing--the language was stilted, the explanations were very formal and required long explanatory chapters on Turing machines to be understandable, and worst of all, they were outdated--some of them were written years before Deep Blue. I purchased this book for a university class on AI and loved it from the minute I opened it. It's very readable, includes both formal and informal explanations of most topics, and is about as up to date as a textbook like this can be. It feels as though it were written for modern readers like me, who prefer to get an intuitive grasp on something before diving in to the formal development. Like all textbooks, it's expensive, but worth it if you're interested in AI. I plan to keep it after my class is over.\n",

      "Content : This is the best introductory review to Artificial Intelligence on the market.  It's very well written and organized.  There are other books that are better for focusing on one particular aspect of AI, but as a general book this is the best I've seen.  If you are looking for a really good introductory textbook to AI that does not completely dumb things down, buy this book.\n",
      "Most of the negative comments about this book come from people stating that it's not a big enough update from the prior edition.  While it's true that the entire field of AI has not been completely updated since the last edition, it's also not the case that this book comes out with new editions with the frequency of some Calculus or Economics textbooks where new editions seem to come out purely to ensure students can't buy a used book for the course.  The updates are substantial.  Whether the new edition gives you enough extra to want to buy it if you own the old edition is a decision only you can make for yourself after spending some time at the website for the book aima.cs.uberkeley.edu.\n",
      "The Kindle conversion of this book is absolutely horrendous.  I prefer to buy electronic copies of books if possible so I don't have to carry a heavy hard copy around since I often read while commuting.  I would not recommend that for this book, even though at a 1000+ textbook sized pages, it is a pretty substantial book.  Fortunately a friend of mine had bought a Kindle copy of the book and I was able to see how bad it was and I bought the hard copy.\n",
      "I recently got an email telling me Amazon was sending out an updated version of the Kindle version of Steve Job's biography because the conversion hadn't been done properly.

      "Content : This review is organized into two parts. The first part gives a general overview of the textbook and my thoughts about the content, while the second part gives a summary of the problems I've encountered while reading the Kindle version.\n",
      "This book was made by multiple authors. Fortunately, the book's definitions and summaries are generally coherent. It has a through coverage on the history of AI, the definitions (those that are controversial have been noted as such), and provides psuedocode of many algorithms. Similar to other textbooks on this topic, it does not provide run-throughs of those algorithms.\n",
      "The organizations of the book can be improved. I have some problems with the way they organized the material on the second part of the book (II: Problem Solving). Chapter 3 is named \"Solving Problems by Searching\", but I didn't realize all they did was on classical searches in Chapter 3 until I read Chapter 4. They could have explained why uniform-cost search is uninformed search even though it has a cost function better than they did in the textbook. A better naming scheme for those chapters would be \"Ch3: Global Search \", \"Ch4: Local Search/... (I would suggest breaking Chapter 4 and put it into different places.)\".\n",
      "I bought the Kindle version, and it had many formatting problems. Most of them are minor (such as missing a \"space\" between two words, images appearing in different locations, image sizes too small, etc.) However, I had caught one specific error in the second part of the book (somewhere between chapter 3-5) where the fact is exactly the opposite than the one written (forgot to add the negation?)

      "Content : I like this book, but the kindle edition is full of weird artifacts. This has rendered many in-line mathematical formulas largely unintelligible. For an example, every logical expression for \"x and y\", where the \"and\" should be a wedge, has instead been converted into a caret, which in every case is floating almost directly over the first variable. In another example, there is a reference to the \"one-element vector h0.6i.\" It seems that the h and i were probably brackets originally, but it is impossible to tell.\n",
      "In the real book there are words in the left margin that indicate where in the text a word has been first defined. In the kindle edition these are replaced with immense horizontal bands across the entire page with horizontal rules above and below, taking up three full rows of text, and they appear below the text that they refer to. Three of those in one paragraph, and you're lucky to even get the paragraph on the same screen with them, much less use them as a nice guide to where words are defined. All practical use they had in the real book is completely obliterated, and now they just take up a lot of room on the screen and make the book harder to read.\n",
      "In the few places where they've kept the original formulas by means of images, the images look a little like they came from a malfunctioning copier. This is less of a problem than the other issues, but it is still annoying.\n",

There are subject headings inserted after the subject is spoken about and, quite often, many heading stacked up on top of each other taking up almost an entire page with useless titles that are in the wrong order anyway. There are no page numbers, which is unacceptable for a text that is used by many college AI programs across the country. There are tons of hyphenation errors. The delineations between figure notes and the text are almost imperceptible so it is difficult to tell what text goes where.

This book is unlike anything i have read before. For the last 20 years, I as a lay person, who has not taken any university classes in AI and programming have had problems  moving passed certain levels of complexity in my understanding. Simple things like decision tress and recursion had eluded me in the many books i read, seeming intangible in the areas where they would interface to the real world. Reading the explanations in this book i have finally got it. These authors through scenarios, explanations and code (replicated in many languages on the companion website) explain decision based structures and there use in agent design ,assuming very little along the way, outside of an elementary understanding of programming and logic, thus not losing me the reader. They gave me the building blocks and showed me how and why i would want to assemble them.\n",

      "- This 3rd Edition is alas AIMA 2.1 and not the AIMA 3.0 that I was waiting for. The new material and new insightful way to organize past material are both scant. Certainly not worth the price for those who own the 2nd Edition.\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, if you are about to buy your first AI textbook, this is a great buy as it is still light years ahead of the competition. But some chapters that were getting really thin and outdated in 2009 did not get significant updating.\n",
      "This is particularly true for knowledge representation. Missing are all the recent yet already consolidated advances brought about by the new solutions to the frame problem (such as the fluent calculus), default reasoning, abduction-based and case-based diagnosis, rule-based reasoning (such as constraint handling rules, answer sets, object-oriented logic programming etc.), in short, all forms of reasoning that are neither pure deduction, nor probabilistic. Advances on multi-agent reasoning are also not covered. I understand that to summarize AI in 1000 pages many important topics will not make the cut, but I feel, as a researcher on the topic for the past 25 years and lecturer on it for the past 15 years, that this 3rd edition contains obsolete stuff from the 80s (like frames, semantic networks, production systems, situation calculus, etc.) instead of their modern substitute listed above.\n",

Optimistic predictions of the future of A.I. in that decade only partially came true in the decades after that. Currently, the field is divided up into subfields going by the names data mining, computational intelligence, intelligent agent theory, expert systems, etc. This book is the best book available for learning about this fascinating and important subject. The applications of A.I. are enormous, and will increase dramatically in the decades ahead. Indeed the prospects are very exciting, and the authors themselves have been involved heavily in extending the frontiers of the subject. Some of the main points of the book that really stand out include:\n",
      "1. The useful exercises at the end of each chapter. 2. The discussion of simple reflex and goal-based agents. 3. The treatment of constraint satisfaction problems and heuristics for these kinds of problems. 4. The overview of iterative improvement algorithms, particularly the discussion of simulated annealing. 5. The discussion of propositional logic and its limitations as an effective A.I. paradigm. 6. The treatment of first-order logic and its use in modeling simple reflex agents, change, and its use in situation calculus. There is a good overview of inference in first-order logic in chapter 9 of the book, including completeness and resolution. 7. The treatment of logic programming systems; the Prolog language is discussed as a logical programming language. Noting that Prolog cannot specify constraints on values, the authors discuss constraint logic programming (CLP) as an alternative logic programming language that allows constraints. 8. The discussion of semantic networks and description logics. 9. The treatment of conditional programming via the conditional partial-order planner (CPOP). 10. Representing knowledge in an uncertain domain and the semantics and inference in belief networks. 11. The brief discussions on stochastic simulation methods and fuzzy logic. 12. The discussion on computational learning theory 13. The treatment of neural networks, especially the discussion of multilayer feed-forward networks and the comparison between belief networks and neural networks. 14. The brief discussion on genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming. 15. The discussion on explanation-based learning and the technique of memoization. 16. The (excellent) overview of inductive logic programming. This relatively recent area was new to me at the time of reading so I appreciated the discussion. The authors briefly mention the approach of discovery systems and the Automated Mathematician (AM). 17. The interesting discussion of telepathic communication between robots via the exchange of internal representations. 18. The discussion on a formal grammar for a subset of English and the extensive treatment of natural language processing. 19. The discussion of speech recognition and the use of hidden Markov models and the Viterbi algorithm. 20. The fascinating discussion on robotics, particularly the treatment of configuration spaces, which brings in some techniques from computational geometry and topology. 21. The discussion on the philosophical ramifications of A.I. Future developments in A.I. will provide a unique testing ground for philosophy, in a way that will be unparalleled in the history of philosophy. Philosophers critical of A.I. will have the opportunity to check whether their arguments against the possibility of &quot;strong A.I.&quot;, are in fact true.\n",

      "Title : Very well written very consise introductory book on AI\n",
      "Content : This book is very well written makes the complex subject a little easier to comprehend.  The best thing about this book however is probably the integration of historical accomplishments inside the text.  You don't just get an explanation on why something is and thats it, you get to see how an idea originated and evolved over time.  I wish more computer science books integrated the history of the genre like this book does.\n",
