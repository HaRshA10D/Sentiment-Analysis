There is some in this world worth fighting for
Trump just put the bigger dick policy theory to work
the Carlin some good and we definitely have a problem with the military industrial Congressional complex in this country he to point out a few the United is not a warlike country the Revolutionary War and the War of we re protecting ourselves from aggression and their refusal to allow us to print their own money similar to what is happening today with that fake Bank known as the Federal Reserve war was a attempt by the Catholic Church to subjugate their puppet the the same could be said about their puppet which and got their handed to them World War and World War we re long before the United those and were fighting against tyranny North a communist Nation with the assistance of the Nation of the South and South ask for United intervention with the United the same can be said for South period although I do not believe we should have been in the South fact that we were to come but did not understand when we should have left it was Communist aggression just like it s communist aggression today it s just hidden behind a new world order the war in and are both by the United and its allies and are wrong They are the only that I agree with him on was to protect a group of people who were being Again by of the Antichrist Catholic Church almost every war in the world if you will find that the Catholic church is behind it somehow No they don t come right out and show their culpability they hide behind their and their other secret this liberal Bigmouth had some about different that I agree with but for the most part he s your typical liberal which is anti United and anti white and again is nothing but a front for Catholic aggression And that goes for the too every one of them me sick that the pope was to speak before all the House and Senate there was a time when he t even in the United and the people of this country have forgotten their history and are to repeat it everything I said is true and I have no hatred towards any group of people just some of their belief There are many wonderful Catholic people but they fail to realize the history of their Church anyway my point is that the United history is not of aggression until recently by the way I support the that are in and I just don t support the attack in general on these anybody with half of a brain should be able to see that was a scam to take away our freedom and had very little to do with they are a scapegoat and will anger the nation s just like the they would period but the real threat comes from
they did bomb white country as far as i know mine
Think beyond the cheap to see what this very funny man really was a darling of the and a danger to everything that brought him fame riches I wonder if he ever knew of Taffy or the Bataan Death March or if he of the saving of South from calamity or the very world from He those who or were in body and mind to safeguard his making a buck He foully that war What is is and detest war even though they are good at it when push comes to shove The world an unpayable debt to those this
we out like what with
I think he s off base about U S And being a does not make you correct He obviously think he s above the symbol simple minded Although agree with him on after War
War can be properly defined as an outward manifestation of severe mental illness When insecurity start an armed conflict with sovereign then send innocent young and men to die for some military War profiteering can be at as just another added bonus President Trump recently a Billion increase in military spending to the absolute delight of the military industrial complex I suppose this money will come in handy when or North as I suggest sending all the of the old in the Congress and Senate to the next wing ding
Watch a Documentary Why we fight
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE tell me the name of that entire stand up of his if have so fat only seen of it but I wish to watch it entirely Perhaps someone where I can watch it
Comic genius may he rest in peace

You ignorant are all wrong If it were not for the all of the the population of the world have been unsustainable long ago There would have been a society with two classes the rich who had the power to take all the food and water they and everyone else who would need to kill to keep from Because your kind are and don t believe in for self defense you would have the first to go
Bush Dick and Colin did it twice
That guy was incredible Telling loud and clear is opinion No politicly correct Saying it as it is R I P Mister Carlin There s no one like you today So sad

Carlin was way ahead of the times
white people bombed by the US air force with UN support It s not fair blame the US for all those the rest of the world were more than happy to give the Police of the World rule to the US Just take a look at the criticism about s decision not to intervene on The US were actually blamed by the massacre of there The truth of the matter is that everybody to have someone to do their dirty work and even more when they can criticize this someone for doing it The first thing every hero needs is a villain to oppose
From show is this From that show in new york
did bomb white people In In Just because the heroin money was too tempting to refuse
The best of stand up I ever seen Genius

The cautionary note may contain coarse language is as funny as his monologue The press in this country certainly have a credibility gap issue its getting every year High rise building s are also a metaphor for the manhood patriarchal age The bigger the high rise the bigger the of the architect But take heart we are entering pardon the pun the matriarchal age hope the ladies can do it better
it s true look like giant
I don t know why are laughing they should be crying instead but I guess he is right to be a good you got off you brain
Tried to subscribe t but I anyway
extremely funny but pure wisdom sadly
Man he is so insightful damn Why oh why we don t see as they r

I lost it at em to death
most roll over on command
was probably one of the very few i truly like He knew how the world is working and the stench was so unbearable that cynicism become the only sanity exit
This is guy might not be funny but he some sense into us You will be
Come on War because over compensation is insane in itself Little over simplified I understand most of all complicated are always least likely to happen What I m trying to say is you re up by over something that already with is an injustice The war we been fighting in the Middle East was over Also because the fact that the gorilla army or terrorist group known as supposedly that they s of mass destruction The leader of said group was a ex agent and had worked with the bush family as well for many of We along with have been this group the entire time to fight the Cold War aka the To now everything since the Cold War in to succeed with the greater project formed for the major distraction of the expansion of allied power in the Middle East The end goal is to expand and make that particular country a super power more than the US ever been this is all my own and
the last point was super insightful
War is no longer about one s country It s about and profiting off of it saw the money in war early on and it That s why we have endless so that involved in military defense can receive an endless stream of heavy money When one war a new war to continue the flow of They don t care about the people in the country They care about filling their with a fortune and they don t care if there is blood on it
This guy was Pure Genius I m surprise the Government t make him
He left out white people in the who were bombed by
a friend of mine made a good point if we the weapon responsible for all the them they would be out of business
it s funny because he a point But I lost friend s over in sand box I never joke about that we the United State s will maybe make from time to time But let me this very clear I love all my fellow s and I love my country
we only fight the want and tell us to fight because every god damned conflict with other and then they hide behind the pussy
Every gun that is made every warship every rocket fired in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and are not This world in arms is not spending money alone It is spending the sweat of its the genius of its the of its This is not a way of life at all in any true sense Under the of war it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron D
wut do u think about police n military I think they are not even protecting us at all there s some that I cant even describe
man I wish you was still around he would have had fun with
Glorification of war is a disease in War war stripped of her government her people of their and police the exact same thing a closed society based entirely on psychopathic behavior armed above the law an occupation force seeking the adrenaline rush that comes from kicking someone to death or shooting down a suspect generally a panicked individual facing jail for parking or back child support perhaps even unpaid student Our police are the of our slave labor society the same as our military is the for a global monstrosity
I still miss he was the man
